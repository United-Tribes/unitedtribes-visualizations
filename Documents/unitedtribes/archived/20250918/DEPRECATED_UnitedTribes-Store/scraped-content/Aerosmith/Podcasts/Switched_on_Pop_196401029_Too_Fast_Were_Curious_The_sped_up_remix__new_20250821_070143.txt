FULL EPISODE TRANSCRIPT
==================================================

Welcome to Switched on Pop, I'm producer Rihanna Cruz. I'm songwriter Charlie Harding. And I'm musicologist Nate Sloan. So the other day when I was browsing TikTok, I heard this. I didn't know that I could enjoy Aerosmith any less than I already do. Right, so that is a sped up version of Aerosmith's Dream On. And I'm super piercing. It feels so slow now. It feels like glacial. It's the slowest song on earth. Right, and the audacity of it being an Aerosmith dub got me thinking about how TikTok and other video platforms have been founded on user-generated audios, but specifically over the past few months something called sped up audios. Audios? What are we talking about? I'm so confused about everything that's happening right now. Okay, old man. Buckle up, Charlie. You can't scroll on TikTok for more than a minute without hearing one of these. And like we just heard in the Dream On example, sped up audios are songs that are accelerated in tempo and sometimes pitched up ever so slightly to be faster and lighter. Take the song Escapism by Ray and 070Shake currently charting at 73 on Billboard. This is the original. I think that's a pretty great song, but the popularity of the song is motivated by remixes. Notably a sped up version which has 334,000 videos on TikTok and even a super sped up version that has even more videos. The sped up version that is officially on Spotify has just a mere 30 seconds shaved off but it sounds like this. Yeah but let's take it up a notch and hear the escapism super sped up version. We're verging into drum and bass territory here. I like it a lot more than I expected I would to be honest. Yeah that's sort of the core sentiment. Everybody kind of likes them a little bit more and we don't really know why. Everything is getting sped up in the past few months like Steve Lacy's Bad Habit. own and me Repubest and Steve Lacy. Yeah that has an interesting effect it made it sound very childlike. Miss You by Oliver Tree is blowing up right now. So good. Nobody can play piano that quickly that on beat. It's so inhuman. It's crazy even old songs are being boosted by the sped up treatment. Say It Right by Nelly Furtado sped up version has nearly 25 Million Spotify streams. Two or the other phone flaps and. It's crazy because these remixes are putting songs back on Radio Bloody Mary by Lady Gaga was released and Twenty Eleven by It's Back On The Radio Now propelled by the sped up remakes, soundtrack and clips of the show Wednesday. Guessing any videos that has and six I'd. Go with a two point three million. What this or religious, I'm gonna say eight hundred thousand. Charlie's More in the ballpark. Three Point Five million. Videos. Prices right rules. I were wusa home or so. This led to a sort of craze around this that a body out there is full spot if I play lists and the market dedicated to sped. Up remixes. The playlist sped up songs on Spotify has almost a million lakes and a similar playlist called Team Beats has almost two million. The tag sped up on tic Toc This stop blew me away. Sixteen billion views. And words consistent. Horrified when people would is have at nights. This is really and soon. I mean I think Charlie my probably have the same question at this point was rooted. maybe ask simultaneously one two three while developing a personal like you guys that the big questions. Are where did these come from? Why do they exist? And Why do people listen to them? By. It. Before we talk about sped up remixes, we gotta talk about their predecessor, The Concurrent from the The Slowed Down remix. That happening to. It's happening at the same time, the sort of slowed and reaver movement, but also serves as a predecessor. The playlists floating reverb has six hundred and forty four thousand lakes, and slowed edits have millions of views on you tube and millions of videos. On Sept thought to chill out for a second. Absolutely here is and already chill song he waves by glass animals. Fear. that as a deeply show slowed down and reverbed version of glass animals. I. Mean, when I'm hearing that, I'm thinking this has some historical precedent was the slowed down effect. I think probably the first kind of antecedent that comes to mind is that chopped and screwed music of Dj screw out of the Houston hip hop scene. In. The early two thousands. He. Would take an iconic track Lakes Juicy by the Notorious Be I of. And here's Dj Screws Chapters group. Screwed. Thing which means slowing down. But. It also chopped where we have some alterations to the original were certain beats have been duplicated for the we just a little bit different but it's and the same bad bright red. just like this slowed and reverbed phenomenon that Riyadh is describing slows down the track but also adds these layers of reverberation to make the slow down track kind of sound even more gooey and sludgy. lot of if you think that one of the antecedents years gonna be dubbed music which would have taken original. recording and sent it through tape machines and reverb to put the song and an entirely new context auto i think I think the influence of Jamaican dub of the 60s and 70s is really important here. And I also think this phenomenon of like speeding up and slowing down music goes back even further because it's one of the properties of the first kind of recording technology, the record player, that you can pretty easily take a recording and simply by changing how fast that record spins make it sound faster or slower. So it's a really easy manual process. And people were experimenting with this from the very birth of recording, like our friend Thomas Edison back in 1878 when he was demoing the very first phonograph machine. And at this point, they weren't even using vinyl or shellac or even wax. If it microphones. They were using tinfoil. No joke. Tinfoil. Okay, musicology. So they would bring this tinfoil phonograph around to different cities and they would show up in your local music hall. And they would also have a cornet player play a melody into the phonograph and then they would show how you could slow it down or speed it up. So imagine you have this cornet player playing something, I don't know, maybe like this. And then in playback, it'll get faster and slower and slower. And people would have their 1878 faces melted right off. So people have always been transfixed by this sort of slowed and sped up phenomenon. Totally. Even 10 years ago, a recording of Dolly Parton's Jolene being played at 33 and a third speed than the intended 45 rpm speed went viral because people couldn't believe how uncanny it is. Oh, wow. And you can see why that captured people's imagination because simply by slowing this track down, it transforms it. The groove sounds completely different. You can appreciate how pitch perfect her vocals and her phrasing are. It's a really interesting and revealing kind of musical process and something that we've been obsessed with for like over a century as musical listeners. I mean, I find it interesting that the Dolly part in video was posted to YouTube because I think YouTube culture has played such a big part in moving these mixes into the public consciousness thinking of a scene like vaporwave, for example, which was a micro genre in the 2010s, but essentially like chopped the screwed lounge music and blew up due to the popularity of songs like Macintosh plus is Lisa's name for any. I feel like you're building an argument that says that there's a pendulum swing from the 2010s. Vaporwave slowed down everything on YouTube to now we're just speeding everything up in the 2020s. Oh, absolutely. I mean, as much as I want a vaporwave revival, I think the 2020s are ushering in the sped up remixes era and YouTube has always played a factor in popularizing different tempo remixes, but sped up remixes are sort of a new phenomenon. It has roots in electronic offshoots thinking of like UK garage, juke footwork and other DJ based genre. genres, which tend to have sped up vocal samples as a cornerstone of the tracks. Looking at Duke, DJ Rashad's In the Club Before 11 O'Clock is a great example. Oh, this makes sense because these genres all have BPMs over 130 or so. And so if you want to find a sample to get it into your track, you're going to have to speed it up and it's going to pitch the thing up. Right. The normal BPM of footwork, I think, is like 160. So it makes a lot of sense that these are sort of in tandem. The idea of the sped up remix also has a precedent of selling all the way back to the 50s and 60s. You've probably heard this one before, the novelty hit, Witch Doctor. And if you're thinking that sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks, it's because it's by the same guy. It was once the biggest song in America. The success created the Chipmunk characters and the rest is history. I love that this is the oar text of all contemporary sped up TikTok audios. It also gives us the name of a very popular genre from the aughts, Chipmunk Soul. Yes, absolutely. And Nate, if you're too antiquated and you don't know, it's the pitching up of R&B and soul samples and hip hop, namely from producers like Just Blaze. You could hear it on Cameron's classic, Oh Boy. Just Blaze. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. That's fascinating because Chipmunk Soul has got slow BPM beats, but fast sped up sampled like the contrast. The big sort of heyday of Chipmunk Soul was in the early 2000s, but a more modern example that more aligns with the current fad that we have now is the subgenre of Nightcore. The New York Times wrote a really great article on Nightcore in relation to sped up remixes, but the core of the idea is that there's anime visuals with dubstep-y and Eurodance tendencies supplementing sped up already existing songs. This is one of the big Nightcore songs that I used to hear in like 2018 on like Musically and the early days of TikTok. It's Monster by Megan Dia, Nightcore Remix by Baron Gates. So much like the Dolly Parton remix on YouTube was slowing down Dolly Parton, Nightcore is like turning the RPM on a record player up to 45. Nightcore. That whole subculture needs a like flashing lights and fast sound content warning before participating I feel like. Alvin Core. Totally. It's like for very online younger people and more recent underground pop scenes like the PC music subculture have harnessed this energy in more traditional pop songs. Thinking of a song like Hannah Diamond's cover of Concrete Angel by Gareth Emery and Christina Dobali. Is it Robin? I can do it. I mean I love it personally. This is my jam. So we have precedent in the last couple of years. I mean I love it personally. This is my jam. So we have precedent in juke, footwork, electronic offshoots, Nightcore, all of that. That leads us to today where the pop. You already have sped up remixes has led to artists directly commissioning producers. For. Said remixes. An article from Business Insider called that splintering were multiple unofficial remixes of the same song. Take off simultaneously used to be done with club remixes. But. Now it Johnny Clarity, who is the Ceo of the music marketing agency Song Flu Answer said that often producers will be commissioned on the low to remix trucks, upload them organically and make it seem like they're coming from nowhere. But. It's a big industry plants type of release where they seem organic, but they're actually coming from the inside, the sped up mixes or calling from inside the house of A you say that they are split up remixes. Let's be real. I don't move to doubt the phone that we have will be here these things but it's not really a remix of All you gotta do is you dropped this thing in your software. You're stressed the audio region one way and put on remix. It's different than. Dj screw and dog and make court denied adding anything gray. They're just seems in the speed right which makes it. So. Fascinating because it has led to artists releasing official remixes their songs on official streaming platforms. Samuel Votto has released a set of remix of cool. for the summer. Hundred that has released bulls. A top not flop. Remakes of them changes as well as sped up remakes. Top not flop to your the right. It is essentially the modern shop screwed done by the the Campbell thick. And owed year on says. Here's. The original. Home. Here's the edge. Topknot set up remix. And here is the officially remixed sped up version of them changes. And listening to a chopped and slopped in the sped up version of the song back to back makes me think about what these two approaches do to a song. And something that I noticed is when I'm listening to the slowed down chopped not slopped version, I have this kind of dissociative experience. I kind of like lose sense of time. My mind starts to drift and I find myself just kind of like slowly bobbing my head. Whereas when I listen to the sped up version, my whole body's like, I'm like feel my heart like starting to erase a little bit. I guess what I'm saying is I have completely opposite psychosomatic responses. And I guess that's part of the appeal of a sped up remix. It impacts the body, right? Like a sped up remix is going to make you, for example, scroll faster, work faster, whatever. Because it's like an auditory Adderall kind of where it revs up your body, you know, and a slowed down remix. Specifically a slowed in reverb mimics the feeling of relaxation kind of winding your body down, you know, like lying down on your bed, staring at the ceiling type beat. Yeah, shifts in heartbeat almost. So would you say that the effect that these songs have on our body is part of the reason that people are making these remixes? So, you know, including that there's a couple of reasons as to the why. Why people would do this, why these are popular. It kind of mimics the precedent of terrestrial radio where radio at times speeds up songs. I turned on the radio the other day and I heard that's all by Genesis, but instead of the opening cords sounding like this... Ooh. Subtle. It's subtle, but it's kind of like, hey, we need to get to our seven minute commercial break a little bit faster or it could use those extra 15 seconds for a sponsor. Right, and if you do that multiple times in an hour, it gets in more commercials. You can play more songs, and in a little conspiracy theory brain, it makes them sound fun and more brighter. So in comparison on other stations, it's not as exciting. Right, because every radio station has its own compression algorithm. They're all treating the music just a little bit differently, so they sound the best. And I wonder if it even is related to the fact that it used to be very common for singles to have a radio cut, which would be shorter. Again, better for radio play, but in the age of radio no longer being dominant, maybe not as many people are producing those radio-ready, shorter songs. And so, yeah, just speed it up a little 5%. Yes, exactly. I did that in less than five minutes on GarageBand. I sped it up less than 10 BPM, and the song ended up being 30 seconds shorter. So that's exactly it, Charlie. It kind of mimics the sort of prioritizing of three-minute pop songs in a traditional sense. And extending to TikTok, these songs, these sped-up remixes, blow up on these platforms because they're ideally timeframes of 15 seconds to a minute. It exposes people to more of the songs and sort of feeds the rabid consumerism that's on the app, inviting users to participate. Because like I said, I made that Genesis sped-up version in less than five minutes. You know, it's extremely easy. easy to make these, whether it's on Audacity, GarageBand, or even something like Logic. I feel like it's connected to the adage of don't Boris get to the chorus, but it's more like don't Boris play the chorus even faster so you can hear the entire chorus before the 15 second video is over. Yeah, that one doesn't have quite the same ring to it, Charlie, but I see where you're coming from. Sorry. And another element of why this sort of culture has moved from YouTube, like we previously talked about to TikTok, is that TikTok has a sort of relaxed copyright policy when it comes to remixes, where Nightcore and other remixes get struck down often off of YouTube. But on TikTok, user generated content is designed to thrive, where remixes can blow up and tie into the original in this sort of splintering like previously described. Which plays into your whole conspiratorial notion that many of these sped up and slow down remixes are industry plants because there already is a culture on TikTok of user generatedness of I did it on my own. And so in order to feel like you're playing to the algorithm and playing to the culture, you have to seem as organic as possible. And overall, it's making people more money. Steve Lacy is the king of TikTok lately, Bad Habit hit number one, we did an episode on it. In an interview with The Guardian, he said about the Bad Habit sped up remix, the label asked me if I wanted to put out a sped up version of Bad Habit. I said no, that sounds effing gross. But okay, sure, I'm number two, and I want to be number one. So go ahead. Oh, and it worked. Wow, he did go number one. So these are directly correlating to chart success. Yeah, and more streams. You know, if someone is going to do the user generated version, you better go and claim it and do it first because you want all of those streams which add up to very small fractions of pennies, but more fractions of pennies if people are listening to the original The Slow Down. and sped up. But you know who's really losing in this? Who? Remix DJs. Oh, absolutely. All the great producers that used to make the even more creative slowed down and sped up versions. I mean, right, totally. People are going to lose in this situation, but I guess there are reasons for these remixes to stick around. I mean, as a fan of Nightcore, I can totally see the appeal, right? It's fast, it's high-paced. In the case of Sloed and Reverb, it's calming. I'm not sure if there's extensive artistic merit, but it's something that seems mutually beneficial for the artist and the user. And in the age of TikTok and radical consumerism, I think that has to count for something. Well said. Thanks, Rihanna. At least I don't have to feel guilty about getting down to these sped up audios.
