entered a new era of solo work and we had major comebacks including the return of black pink the day need we're going to do an overdue episode of heartbreakers are we listen to charts to see what kitchen our ears and we're going to do it he pops style this time when looking at south korea's newly launched gullible keep hop circle charts and billboards south korea songs chart and we've invited along journalists christine cloth who writes for rolling stone and variety and who has spoken with reviewed many of today's keep pop acts christine welcome they think he ran the most the insider to do this today very happy to have you here excited to be here okay before we dive in a quick star disclaimer we are not  stance of the genre we are casual k pop listeners who love the music when arab editor jolie turns us on to the great a world of tape hop in our weekly meetings and and indices a chance for us to learn and celebrate so was get into the music the first home owners into his by the group girls' generation their seventh korean language studio miss out there and eat member group they have a song for ever one that was released on august fifth it's their first song and five years and it's their fifteenth anniversary since there are two thousand and seven debut but sick wasn't you forever one my girls from one is number three on billboard and or five on circles the have to admit i first teared up when i heard the song i was having so much fun christine what was your reaction to forever one can tell us about my girl generation ever since as in middle school there were like the first keep upgrades to really stand out to me as an individual i'm just like growing up in america i never really saw like asian artist and like girls i could look up to as role models and things i thought so i think when i first heard that they were making a return after so long i was just like super super that it as a fantasy that hop in because i feel like it's if you on your body and groups on of a time when especially if it's like fifteen years i passing a decade as is really insane the song speak to that return in any kind of way i think so when i spoke to the members they talking about how they topped one of the producers i for their very very first song with this neither review they wanted it to sound like or the an all girls' generation like truly and that type of sound that they've had all these years so sam topping back into those original reds was really cold sea ice it's emotional song because it's such a contrast to most love songs that you hear on the pop charts which are to the object of ones romantic affection this is like a love song to each other friendships and there's something so disarming and refreshing about that that i also just amount of as getting period charlie but i definitely felt other feelings you're one of the things that for me made the song so compelling is the way that this enormous over the top whole we maximalist chorus the games with this really steep melodic descent that then slowly build itself backed up over and over and over again there's something very satisfying and perhaps even connected a little bit the message of like are all getting back together we're in this forever like we might have been away for awhile sit down well it allows so satisfying it's a gym said that it goes down the dirt and then he climbs back guns as soon as that's a that's a beautiful melodic metaphor for overcoming adversity together there might even be a sign of that adversity in the music just as were coming into the chorus there's is very decent know that you think shouldn't work and yet it's such an arena loud for egged i knew your again and soon into that charlie that's so funny i also heard that and jumped out of my the as like what is that doing there it ended right there it would be the tenses ending some over , on on on and oh for we get the sweet resolution of endless forever love forever ever won so much fun and one listen to the section that takes us out of the bridge of the song were all of the sudden girls' generation explodes into with me sounds like the world of hyper off the what you sparkly synthesizers like this segment and then there's there's enormous chorus of voices athena word neophytes to the world of girls' generation are they known for being musically innovative like this because i'm hearing they're pushing a lot of boundaries like charlie and irish hearing and are innately nerdy way dissonant notes in these paper pop excursions it very dexterous the way the members pass vocals back and forth between each other's this like a hallmark of girls' generation i would say the have been very and it with their music and because they've just been around for so long they've had a chance tix i'm at a lot of genres one song that says out from their discography as i got a boy and which came out in twenty thirteen thought was one of the first came off songs act like next maybe three or four genres into ones on in his phone just make yeah like a spectacle almost in a science because it's their first and so long is kind of the traditional k pod county pa a piper parts of the sound but out he had extra layer of fun that you can almost visualize without even having to see the music video it gave me chills i was in tears from talking about talking pull yourself together charlie and let's get to the next sun or good ives loves dies loves dies a six number group debuted in december twenty twenty one from starship and her team and they've got a viral hit on tic toc nearly a quarter million videos made of with the song loved i've got over three hundred and seventy million views and it's current were filed billboard with for on circle the mugged i would love this song i think it's one of the most repeated songs on my own playlist assists sochi of my brother lives is always system of the solve all my friends love the song as says and like really interesting to see put your bio had come from a new recruits and ten resonate with my friends who are older than all the numbers and fantasy that esa i'm hearing some very daring production here and here and contrast to the girls' generation track which was very maximalist like christine says have a spectacle every second of space and that song was filled with some sound is this by contrast is very dialed back there's lot of space there's lot of silence and i feel like the members get to really injects their personality and attitude into those spaces and gaps the course that we just heard their voices are all sort of produced and for bought a size miss very compelling way i think it really matches the bit of the lyric that i'm able to catch here narcissistic my god i love there's something really resident about their voice being super process and sort of made up that connects with this idea of like there's gonna be as over the top narcissistic as i possibly can and i'm just going to embrace it it's very potent moment and then the martha the wondering i'm curious about is that you mentioned it's fairly unusual for a group like girls' generation to have a fifteen year long career in the world coupon here you also had i've may be unusual for never such a big hit as such a new group could you say a bit about how career length impacts music can keep up i would say about a i haven't seen that a lotta groups are kind of promoting longer these days anything you feel and maybe groups or break up due to draw our conflicts with their label or anything like that but these days i think there's a collective effort to stay together as a group and i think members to see that it is power and seeing together and there's a couple of groups who may have left their longtime label but they're still promoting as a group stairs groups that has left their longtime label and had to start with a new name and you kind of concept ted and and of said away from their original group that the company owns the ip for that i think a standard from what i've seen as qui groups will sign on with an initial seven year contract and then from their members we'll reevaluate and see if they want to renew but doesn't it and suspect if it's always awesome to see to stay together and or that are be tests part of what makes came up so appealing as like zoc group dynamic and their relationship to see that summer breeze have with each other which is really fun for my third term breaker pick today when i was into a song goes in a totally different vibe spy the group new jeans their five member the group there are new group makes sense to called new jeans much as a pants but also like sort of thing like the new generation can pop music their debut single came out july twenty second and it is doing so well the song is called attention of captured our attention it's currently number one on billboard's number one on circle chart the track is a jam my about as adults will eat he is just so god this before we dive into music logical analysis of this track proceed because there's much to unpack would he tell us about new genes which we know about this group my charlie manson they're very they're very know i think the youngest son bring a good might be fortune years old so they're also very young i think it's interesting to see such a graham do so well so early i and and i think we're seeing more and more in cape often john all new of all everyone's talking about these days so glad that is suing on the chart subtle if he is interesting and has a lot of fun songs despite the youth of this group of the sound feels very retro kind a throwback and if i know my friend and collaborator charlie harding you've got about fifteen references dials up from the early two thousand for us to listen to or i dunno maybe i'm wrong try are you are you hearing any specific references here and attention for attention just is steeped in nine these are and be dimming contemporary but there's something about that smooth jazz he pours and laid back feel reminds me of almost like sw v or song really rich harmonies laid back that that swing their new jack swing rhythm okay so sad early two thousand and it's mid late nineties can we listened to the very beginning of the track cause there's a beat switch the first of all what is i'm of what this sample is it sounds like some kind of group chant or something like maybe kids on a playground i love it  you hear it and you think okay the sun the downbeat is at the very beginning that samples like dead it added added at at at that added added added added at got bed and added added added it up with no the new jeans is trickling us into thinking that the downbeat of the song because in fact when the be dropped somewhere else entirely caught , on not other her neck gets your attention to very savvy mood all these i mean when i listen to all of these songs that to generalize but they all start in such dramatic ways like i feel like these songs i really trying to grab your attention as a listener and i wonder if that's the more cynical part of me says is that because it's such a crowded field and these acts are trying to find any way to like stand out amongst the competition to that be an explanation for the hooky intros that we here in all the songs yeah they've been more experimental with a whole release of the cp it's i'm not sure how severely there you are with their album roll out but there's cds i believe actually com and like a cute little prosperity back that sounds can buy and it's like circular shape to the city fc comes in the bag so they've tried new concepts was even just like the album packaging and it's even nicer that from the concept of everything is just so well thought out and plans which i think was worked in their favor in terms of trying to break into such a crowded space the didn't daring stuff they've really caught my attention because the first time we hear their voices it's in is very discerning diminished south the mommy boys right there of i think it either and they're going to resolve but it's really tense and it's so satisfying to me how would you finally get the chorus are kind of this like move away from dissonance and arrows are singing the route happily everything feel totally resolved there's a lyric in there that the thing about getting butterflies and taking them to paradise and like out exactly how i feel the sony such a bad also those see the bags that cosine mentioned are available on line up with of are now is to use the company card feared to get a couple of this as do it or it is outsold already i know it's a hot item these days do you want at block white or red i can do black and you can do light and i'll do a red increase , the red berries oh oh we've got our merchant hand a lot of fun music on the charts we have a song that we need to talk about which is not yet on the charts because it just came out today as we are talking is my favorite release the moment but i've got out but after right the brain fog anxiety depression according to social media you can cure all of them by eating yogurt unsurprisingly social media isn't it likely right but there is some really exciting new science showing that what you eat can affect your mental health that what's going on in your that literally changes your brain chemistry and that's exactly what we're getting to the bottom of on this week's episode of gastropub the podcast that looks at food through the lens of science and history i'm nikolaj where they and i'm cynthia graber and this episode we go deep to sort out the science from the social media hype it's a story that involve some very sad mice and a cutting edge us military experiment but it's also news we can all use what should you be eating to combat anxiety depression and more follow gastropub unsubscribe were are you get your podcasts christine the group black pink have a new single out she looked at is a pretty big deal how come that's my take on another level i think i was surprised was surprised as american is aiming to parties just then when isis and to of my whole life going up and to high school and college whatever but i was actually talking to them coworkers yesterday and a lot of them were saying pink was the first k pop group that dot them into the genre and now they're listening some all these other group then was pts selling out stadiums and keep up becoming more and more mainstream and the u s i think been think is also one of the former nurse and that space for this honor as we know it today i think blocking play a major part in bringing back mainstream and the you was so i think this release is a major turning point for the great especially by pinch have been around since when he sixteen but they only have one official studio album that salt lake out right now it's been years since album has come out but they haven't had any new music to listen to so this is a major hi i'm anne sightings discography for sure because we're talking about the song pink phantom the first single off of their new album born pink which they launched with a global campaign com light up the pink which included setting up monumental white art installations across five continents including at the brooklyn bridge monday marble arch and tokyo tower so let's listen to this global sensation though in simi hear the backstory to this release because when i hear this i'm like wow the sun slaps it's like the personality and attitude is just like coming through the speakers of feels like every lyric is in my mind delivered with a sneer   and if i didn't know kind of the steaks of this release i would just think oh this is just you know a chance for this group to late leave it all on the floor of the recording studio bus the going about this in terms of the the ark and the importance of this group it's like whoa know this know this lot riding on this and this is the song is is maybe them saying like we're back where here and we're just as powerful and undeniable as we ever were is my very commanding about having a chorus like that where everything breaks down and almost a quiet moment but it's very hard hitting moment what if there was one aspect of black pink that you think made them such a pipe to the group such a gateway group for so many people would you be able to identify that and and is it something that we hear on this new release i think it really com sounds like the music and just the sound of what they put out it's unique but it's also not to unfamiliar i think with what western audiences my be securing etc like striking and away but also not to unfamiliar where it's unapproachable maybe you had mentioned the girls' generation we're known for mashing up lots of different sounds and genres within a single song and , hear a lot of that going on in pink venom this feels like a master class in the two thousands era hip hop and pop music i thought we could do is walk through a couple of the different sections and think about what are some of the cultural touch points that they might be drawn from will start rate from the very top of the phone how soon as it started i was like oh my god the saw the is so guests i watch the music video and i don't know if you've had a chance to watch it but it starts off with to see you playing a career traditional instrument called the common goals the that stream sound that you're sharing i'm assuming is that instrument unless they're just kinda as speaking at different visual all birds i love when they top it's it's and of traditional korean elements of their songs that so rad that that plucked stringed instrument that food in a very first things we here in the track i love the using traditional sounds because it provides maybe some counterbalance to the tracks reference points that are very much grounded in american rap and hip hop be even though way that they use those traditional string plucks feels like a nod to two thousand hip hop which often borrowed a string sounds from bollywood in the middle east and elsewhere it would hear it for example in missy elliot spitzer for sky they needed a remix of punjabi and c you can even hear it and justin timberlake and his peers not as in instruments but similar kind of sampling vibe here's a book think again i didn't use are deathly coming from different cultural references absolutely but they're sort of tone tambor and effect as there being used some very similar to me some his past tracks that's cool about the black ping track is that unlike some of these other examples it's an instrument been drawn from their own traditional culture and sort of being remix in this way so maybe has a a residence that some of these other tracks wouldn't have in terms of it's cultural impact i think they're also is a bollywood simple and here as well wherever we go from the intro into the verse nor did i write know die but you meet you raise a good point out that does sound like a sample odds and process by which string section right there so we we have a cosmopolitan said of references we we we haven't even talked about the the birds almost sounds like a schoolyard times and status and flag p a lot of as well as rights imo in the first verse ago if we go into a totally other world of references got any tories baiji reference what you know what hop would not want to got this one come on that one really had my brain itching for some familiar at all  the gotten up and the know gotcha their brain it's oh of the pottery play by rian now you're it will buy one to buy to silica little miracle nod and it's got a similar vibe that totally whatever my had spent i mentioned missy elliott earlier i feel like there's a real throwback moment the happens after the chorus which is very much in missy elliott world here doesn't pick that up punk whiny sense and here's a the alias will get on , upon my anger management where's the high one isn't the staple of do you funk and to can here and but the songs the and a music video for that first they actually are kind of wearing more of nineties ask fashions i wonder if such as the official or not to the era that they're referencing and the song there's even a visual nod address thanks isn't and then there was the chorus that have to spray and to sound that i know so well this simplified vibe or the whole saga like sox in and then be just get this really powerful intense moment that's some similarities they're making us look bad and just play the check charles the i think i'm fine i must go references have to say about i think even give us a clue the pre chorus the area the referencing taylor swift look what you made us do the i swear to god a similar kind of similar were the whole sawyer expands under cars expands sucks right in sucks can hear the tic toc mashups already have like already have to attack on had caused by i can hear already like there's a part where she refers to sell their i can then accent as much as the two songs with either a be from one song and then the melody from the other i'm going it occurred to me is that obviously taylor swift doesn't originate as kind of a sound and i tried searching for potential inspirations it probably back into the world hip hop i think there's a certain vibe that we get i'm a song like rocket like of hot wouldn't it be implemented korea's among traffic like a high rabid like ah like island a phd or , fifty cents just a little bit bit enough know there's a way in which hop artists draw from hip hop and take these chorus moments the when superimposing to a pop song feel like the energy has dropped macaques your attention with this rhythmic intensity and persuaded by analysis just oh thanks this is to use their back referred somebody from voices some a different reference points one of the there's anything you feel like is happening amongst these chart breaker picks the rating the y'all are picking up any trends ideas inspirations i think a reference to the past is definitely clear in all the songs were like i say gloves i've by i've been things and on their option of referencing like nineties early two thousand maybe or as a sites have more muted sounds even with attention by new james and nine girls hundred patients forever one is also a reference after a passage through a different lens almost more about that part the any pain can find vibe so it's interesting to see that all the songs we talked about to their friends pass sounds i received them earlier but kind of update on sound to make it feel more of the times today i will you ever seen it as interesting mechanics these forward relief is that i hear is this sense of bold experimentation of collapsing multiple genres into single song and to passing lyrics , and forth in this incredibly dexterous way way music that really demands your attention and i've come away with a new respect for these for keep up groups after this conversation that this is some expansive music it represents the past or present his little bit of everything in it for everybody as a lot of fun for me to go back and must be songs deathly curious to hear what listeners are listening to and or like a par with are enjoying please share that with us and christina wanna thank you so much for
