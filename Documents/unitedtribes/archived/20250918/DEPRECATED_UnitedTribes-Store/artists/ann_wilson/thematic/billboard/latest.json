But on the latest episode of Heart singer Ann Wilson‘s After Dinner Thinks podcast, the “Pink Pony Club” singer made a bold statement about the number one voice in rock. “You’re rockin’ mama! I’m rockin’ because you rockin’, really, truly,” Roan told the singer of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame band.\n“I think you have the best voice in rock,” Roan said to Wilson, noting that “nothing” has ever made her feel as powerful as when she sang Heart’s iconic hit “Barracuda” onstage at the Austin City Limits festival in 2024, introducing it as her “favorite song.”\n“I was like, ‘actually, this is the coolest song ever. And I feel like a rock star!,” Roan said. Fellow guest Lucy Dacus recalled the pair talking about the cover, with Roan telling her at the time, “I remember when you were like, ‘I’m gonna cover this because I want to feel what it feels like in my body to be a rocker like that.'”\nTrending on Billboard\nWilson agreed that it’s a whole different thing to rock out on stage, with Roan saying that pop is fine, but rock, well, it’s a different beast. “A song like that… you can’t hold it in like that. It has to be an independence of the soul where you just let it go and you go, ‘what the f–k? This is a physical event,” Wilson said.\nAfter watching a Heart show before the pod recording, Dacus opined on how most self-described rockers are wannabes who are just pretending, or trying to be a “rock character or avatar. Y’all are just ‘bees,’ you’re not wannabes… they’re trying to be you.”\nThat comment got Roan going, with the “Hot To Go” singer slamming “b–ches who will never come out on stage. They’re just like, ‘oh! I can’t. My arm hurts!’ Like you are… that is punk!”\nElsewhere in the chat, the three women talked about how style plays into their identity, Dacus asked Wilson is she’d ever considered retiring from music and Roan wondered how the singer handled the huge success and pressure to follow-up Heart’s smash 1975 debut album, Dreamboat Annie, when the group went in to record the follow-up. Dacus also talked about attending a Heart show with her birth mother, with Wilson sharing her moving journey adopting two children.\nDefinitely stick around until the end, because Wilson opened up about her record label once sending Paula Abdul to teach Heart some choreography, a move that did not go well.",

Digging into a song she’s always loved, Parton teams up with Heart’s Ann Wilson on a straightforward cover of the latter’s signature 1975 jam “Magic Man (Carl’s Version).”\n“I’ve always wanted a reason to sing ‘Magic Man’ by Heart and it was one of my first choices for the album,” Parton said in a statement. “I was so happy that Ann Wilson agreed to sing it with me. Nobody can out sing Ann, but I gave it my darndest, and we added a few lines that were not in the original. We wanted to have a few things that made it seem like ours. Thank you, Nancy, for letting me fill in for you on this. Hope I’ve made you both proud. I think it’s magic!”\nTrending on Billboard\nIndeed, three minutes in, Parton and Wilson trade lines in a new verse that conjures yet more mystery. “A magic man with luring eyes, changed the course of my young life/ He was a magic man/ I was oh so quick to learn, I was caught up in the burn/ Of the magic man,” they sing. “No one else could understand, unless you’ve loved a magic man.”\nParton’s first rock collection is due out on Nov. 17 and will feature 30 songs, including 21 covers and nine originals. One of those fresh tracks also dropped Friday, “Bygones,” featuring Judas Priest singer Rob Halford, as well as Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx and touring guitarist John 5.\nParton said in the statement that “Bygones” is one of her favorite tracks from the album. “The song fits with so many couples and coupling my voice with Rob, one of my all-time favorites, made it even more special,” she said of the quickstep midtempo rocker on which she and the leatherbound metal yowler meld their sugar and spikes vocals in growly harmony.\n“I’m sorry, so sorry/ How long must you punish me/ Why can’t we just move on/ Let bygones be bygones/ But you never will,” they sing on the chorus. The two tracks were preceded by the Parton-penned first single, “World on Fire,” which charted at No 1 on Billboard‘s Rock Digital Song Sales chart last month.\nListen to “Magic Man” and “Bygones” below.",

And if the set is designed right, it’s just like a natural momentum.”\nAt her concert at the Neptune Theater in Seattle on Oct. 13, Wilson played three songs from her new album, Fierce Bliss, released April 29: “Greed,” “Black Wing,” and a cover of Queen‘s “Love of My Life.” She also performed a number of Heart favorites, such as “Crazy on You,” “Barracuda,” “Even It Up” and “Love Alive” — but not the band’s latter-period hits.\n“Some make the transition to live and some just don’t work,” she says. The Neptune Theatre setlist featured several songs by rock icons, including John Lennon‘s “Isolation,” The Who‘s “Won’t Get Fooled Again,” Aerosmith‘s “Dream On” and Led Zeppelin‘s “Going to California.” Wilson ventured into lesser-known territory too. She led off with Steve Earle‘s “The Revolution Starts Now,” which she recorded in 2020. Jeff Buckley‘s “Forget Her” and “Permission” by Sixx: A.M., the side project of Mötley Crüe’s Nikki Sixx, might have surprised some fans.\nTrending on Billboard\nThe mix of new material, fast-paced rockers and slower, emotional songs was chosen and paced to take the audience on a journey. “This sounds really cold and calculating now that I’m talking about it,” Wilson says with a laugh, “but it’s really the most loving set that I can design to bring people and give them an experience.”\nListen at Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, Amazon Music or iHeartRadio.",

Taking the part originally sung by Mike Reno of Loverboy, Clarkson belted out, “I thought that dreams belonged to other men/ ‘Cause each time I got close, they’d fall apart again,” to which the 71-year-old Wilson effortlessly responded, “I feared my heart would beat in secrecy/ I faced the nights alone/ Oh, how could I have known/ That all my life I only needed you?” before the American Idol champ jumped in on harmony.\nDue to the success of the film, the soft-rock classic rocketed up the charts in the mid-’80s along with Kenny Loggins‘ “Footloose” and Deniece Williams‘ “Let’s Hear It For the Boy” — eventually peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spending 13 weeks in the top 40. The movie’s love theme also hit No. 1 on Billboard‘s Adult Contemporary chart.\nDuring the show, Clarkson sat down with the rock icon for a wide-ranging interview about which Heart classic she’s outgrown (1975’s “Magic Man,” much to Kelly’s chagrin), the sexism that inspired “Barracuda,” her thoughts on the way women are treated in the music industry (“There still is a lot more room for improvement”) and more. Later, she also performed an encore, transfixing the audience with “Love of My Life” from her new solo album Fierce Bliss.\nTrending on Billboard\nWatch Clarkson and Wilson’s Footloose duet as well as more from the Heart rocker’s visit to The Kelly Clarkson Show below.\nhttps://youtu.be/2ggpxR0aqTU\nhttps://youtu.be/hu283Lm5FKs",

I thought how great the song would be if it was stripped down and just sung with soul, and it had to be Vince Gill because he’s got that voice, that soul.”\n“Love of My Life” was included on British rock band Queen’s 1975 album A Night at the Opera, and Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury was the sole writer on the track. It ultimately went on to peak at No. 23 on Billboard‘s Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart in 2018; the chart launched in 2009.\nTrending on Billboard\nFierce Bliss is Wilson’s third solo full-length album, and the first since 2018’s Immortal. Other artists who worked on Fierce Bliss include Kenny Wayne Shepherd on “Bridge of Sighs” and “Missionary Man,” as well as Warren Haynes (Allman Brothers Band/Gov’t Mule) on “Gladiator” and “Angel’s Blues,” both of which he helped produce.\nThroughout his nearly four decades in music, Country Music Hall of Fame member Gill has become one of music’s most sought-after collaborators, in addition to his sterling solo work. Gill, a two-time CMA entertainer of the year winner, has earned hits for collaborations with Reba McEntire (“The Heart Won’t Lie”), Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”), Brooks & Dunn and Sheryl Crow (“Burning Bridges”), and Rosanne Cash (“If It Weren’t For Him”), among others.",
