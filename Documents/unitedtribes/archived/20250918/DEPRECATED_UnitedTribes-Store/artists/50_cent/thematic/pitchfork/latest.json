He is a holdover from the late-2000s DVD era, who first got his name up with local street hits like “Bullet Bullet,” and stumbled into a deal with Roc-A-Fella and a collaboration with Fabolous and JAY-Z, named for their shared borough. As his moniker suggests, he’s always been a voice for the comically violent, and is admittedly known more for industry antics than great songs. But his latest caper, a deal with G-Unit Records last December, has so far produced “Statute of Limitations” and “On and On,” both of which are high-marks in a long career and undeniably catchy if your ear meets them halfway.\nLast week, “On and On” cracked the Top 40 Most-Added Urban chart, which means radio stations are playing it during late night slots. Its success will be largely due to Jeremih holding its hand over an an inviting R&B chop via Reefa & 12 Keys. But the rappers are doing work too. Uncle Murda, who released the single under his given name, Lenny Grant, speaks in sledgehammer hyperbole: his girl is “the baddest bitch on the planet, badder than Beyonce, Halle, and Janet,” and he never cheats on her because she enjoys threesomes. His bluntness is hilariously addictive, with the true to type lines about a dude who still rates flat-brims over dad-hats. 50 sounds like he’s genuinely having fun with the feature, sounding almost like he never lost that sales-off to Graduation. When he sticks the ending with, “No VIP ain’t got shit on shit in here, baby yeah,” you can almost smell the hookah in the air. The whole thing amounts to sweet, second-marriage rap, and makes me even more excited for the next season of “Power.”",

As the hook on YG’s \"I Wanna Benz\", the line almost sits you down with its force. The Compton rapper doesn’t get accused of being a \"lyricist\" too often, but that’s only because he says what needs saying so clearly that we aren’t left with much to squabble over.-=-=-=-\nYG's been relatively quiet this year, except for in June, when he was shot in the studio and popped up shortly after with the song \"Twist My Fingaz\" and another perfect line (\"I'm the only one who made it out the West without Dre/ The only one that got hit and was walking the same day\"). That song had a lot less DJ Mustard, who defined YG’s 2014 near-classic My Krazy Life, and a whole lot more classic G-Funk. \"I Wanna Benz\" is the same: Even though it’s produced by London on da Track, Young Thug’s closest collaborator, it sounds like something from the Above the Rim soundtrack (or Menace II Society, which is quoted in the song's opening). The guests, Nipsey Hussle and 50 Cent, sound as good as they have in years, particularly 50 Cent, who has been flailing uncomfortably in a hit-free vacuum for an eternity. They are representatives of gangsta rap, unchanged by times, and YG's making this music better than everyone else right now.",

There may not be much insight on Animal Ambition, but it does give an accurate survey of where 50 Cent is at right now.\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2014-06-06\n---\n“I even saw when keeping it real...went out of style. Now it’s like, it doesn’t matter what it is, it just matters that it sounds good.” This is 50 Cent letting his guard down in a humble, humanizing GQ profile. Fully aware he hasn’t been the underdog or on top since his indelible hook from the Game’s “Hate it or Love It”, he’s presumably making a plea for sympathy. If it’s not as off the mark as some of his recent pitches, it’s close, since it’d be much easier to take his side if he was, y’know, making music that sounds good. 50 was handsomely rewarded over a decade ago for keeping it real, and whether as a rapper or an actor, the only role Curtis Jackson has been successfully able to play is 50 Cent in Get Rich or Die Tryin'. His last major motion picture role and last album both ended about the same way.\nWhat he doesn’t realize is that if Curtis Jackson really “kept it real” in 2014, we’d get to know the guy behind the Street King energy drink, the self-help books, the consistently entertaining ThisIs50.com website, the near pornographic musculature. Curtis Jackson is a very interesting guy and has never been more likeable than he is right now—and unfortunately, Curtis Jackson is nowhere to be found on Animal Ambition.\nHere, 50 Cent is ditching the unrepentant gangsta rap misanthropy of 2009's Before I Self Destruct, which was just about the only thing it had going for it. But 50’s voice remains one of hip-hop’s great instruments, forever instantly recognizable. He can spend the rest of his life saying basically anything and it’ll sound great, particularly if it conveys any part of the term “fuck-you money.” At the very least, Animal Ambition goes the slightest bit outside of the surgical steel, Beats-EQ’d knockoffs that reliably filled out his past albums (Dr. Dre makes his sole appearance as part of the team behind the antiseptic “Smoke”). “Irregular Heartbeat” could pass for minimal witch house, while the title track undergoes as much as vocal manipulation and obtrusive, blocky production tricks as an Autre Ne Veut song (trust, though, that the results are nowhere near as interesting as the description).\nOtherwise, Animal Ambition doesn’t exist in 2014 as much as it does in some theoretical plane where 50 Cent has the kind of status outlined in Drake’s “Tuscan Leather”—“This ain’t nothin’ for the radio/ But they’ll still play it though.” Hard to believe, but there's ten singles that have been released from Animal Ambition thus far, and they range from passable Hot 97 lurkers to passable bottle service bangers. I could go on pointing out the numerous ways that 50 Cent is trying to score a current club hit playing by his old rules, but I think the mere appearance of “feat. Trey Songz” on the tracklist more than speaks for itself.",

Like most non-musical projects involving 50 Cent, his co-authored book of Machiavellian strategy stood a good chance at being mindlessly entertaining, and fuck-- I wouldn't mind being as rich as he is. Surely, I'd learn some sort of hustling tactic that would allow me to make back my $20 and then some. It held up its end of the bargain on the first part, but amidst the surprisingly practical advice and hilariously revisionist history (a staged thrashing of an Interscope office is remembered as a PR coup for Curtis. Kanye West isn't mentioned once in the book), there was little insight to 50's music-making process. The \"50th law\" essentially lionizes fearlessness and a deep connection with the public, qualities almost entirely absent from his last two albums-- Curtis sounded a hell of a lot like a rap record made by a guy who lives in a Connecticut mansion, while the profoundly bored War Angel LP only served as proof of how the mixtape game he revolutionized had completely passed him by.\nBut 50's nothing if not calculating, and while Before I Self Destruct might not be designed to reach the pretty impressive first week sales of Curtis, it may be a wiser move making it to appeal to listener who still might be rooting for the guy. In other words, the sort of guy who thought \"Blood Hound\" and \"Back Down\" were by far the best tracks from Get Rich or Die Tryin'. It's transparent pandering on the level of \"Amusement Park\", but the difference is that 50 still can rap convincingly about his financial power moves whereas every bit of sexual pursuit simply bores him to death-- he can't even really make a love song about his guns these days (see \"Hold Me Down\").\nHe's still got that voice, and when he wants, it can still intoxicate and overwhelm with sheer menace. \"The Invitation\" and \"Death to My Enemies\" snarl with a ferocity that's refreshing in the context of 50's recent output as well as the current hip-pop landscape where meat'n'potatoes gangsta is actually kinda novel. He disarmingly sings along with the Jackson 5 sample that begins \"Then Days Went By\" before reshaping his \"Hate It or Love It\" verse into a squalid blaxploitation that makes you think he'd view Precious as a comedy. There's the part where a trip to the South turns into a murder spree and he pistol-whips his drug-addled uncle, but it's his staggering anti-romance that provides the most creepy shock: \"she was 20, I was 12/ Nana said she raped me/ I just smiled ear to ear saying 'take it, baby, take it.'\"",

Certainly not Ross-- befitting his completely dysfunctional relationship with reality, he took 50 as a serious threat to his non-existent credibility and somehow ended up with the best album of his life. Not 50 either-- hilarious transmissions from ThisIs50.Com served as better promotion for When I Get Around to It (or whatever he's calling his TBA follow-up to Curtis) than any of his recent singles. And if you were a fan who didn't feel the need to choose sides, or young enough to consider Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Ricky Steamboat the equal of KRS and Rakim in 1988, it was rap-as-Wrestlemania at its finest.\nSo why the *War Angel LP? *50's gone on record saying the LP appendage in the title is necessary to let rappers know they need to act like 50's competing with them for a record deal, mixtape or not. Granted, he's been popping this \"back to basics\" shit since before Curtis (we saw how that ended up), and the biggest problem is how 50 is trying to get back to a version of himself that never existed. Even with Power of the Dollar, you didn't rely on 50 for hot punchlines, detailed street narratives, or thoughtful wordplay. You could tell from the start that he was primed to embody the New York Yankees state of mind-- when they're winning, their arrogance and loose spending make them a fantastic heel; when they're losing, you just get pissed that you're still forced to care. He's at his best when he's at his most mercenary (as if you have to be reminded, he's made two albums called Get Rich or Die Trying), and on War Angel, 50 raps like someone who knows better than to give quality shit away for free.\nForget \"48 Laws of Power\"-- you'd think 50 brushed up on Hobbes' Leviathan the way every warfaring and solitary track is nasty, brutish, and short, with verses of anonymous threats that begin and end at almost completely arbitrary points. Like it was a latter-day Kool Keith album. And although his lisping, sing-song cadence is still a hell of salesman for any hook he comes up with, here he mostly just repeats the song's title over and over again. Like it was a latter-day Kool Keith album. And the album's clear highlight is a skit boasting a possibly fictional event in the projects with completely random guest stars (all the kids get taken to Great Adventure after a pickup game featuring Tim Thomas and Rafer Alston). Like a…seriously, are Pimpin' Curly and Dr. Dooom drinking buddies?",

Not only has the muscle-bound hip-hop colossus modeled his career after the cutthroat guide, he's working with Greene on a street-flavored addendum called The 50th Law. So far, the four dozen over-the-top credos have worked swimmingly for 50: He's sold more than 20 million albums worldwide since 2003 while pulling in auxiliary profits with Vitamin Water and other less amusing side hustles. But these days, when it comes to music, 50 Cent looks vulnerable; most of the advance singles from Curtis underperformed, and the Queens rapper has a good chance of losing this week's transparent SoundScan battle to Kanye West (if not country bumpkin Kenny Chesney). What's a power-starved, protein-shaking egomaniac to do? Well, re-reading his personal Bible would be a good start …\nLaw 46: Never Appear Too Perfect-- It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to appear more human and approachable.\nIn this week's Rolling Stone feature on 50 Cent, the rapper claims, \"I'm King Kong. Kanye is human. Humans run when they see King Kong, because they're scared.\" He's right. Hulking, inelegant, and hopelessly primitive, 50 Cent is hip-hop's doomed beast. On Curtis, he sets out to re-energize his base by reminding us of his strengths: He fucks and kills with ease, he needs five deposit envelopes every time he hits up an ATM, and he's a hit with the ladies. But, as Greene makes clear, there's no depth or dynamic to that kind of perfection-- it's like watching a big dildo machine make big dildos all day. While 50 never made a habit of flaunting his faults like Kanye (or Em or Big or 2Pac…), he could usually back up his tales with indelible beats, swaggering hooks, and a flow that slithered like original sin. But those once-bountiful gifts are all heavily downgraded-- or altogether absent-- on Curtis.\n50 should be able to work with producers who could conjure his hit-making abilities, but instead the MC mostly sticks with tried-and-failed G-Unit stalwarts and Dre-aping up-and-comers that do him few favors. Nearly every instrumental-- from the cartoon menace of \"My Gun Go Off\" to the assembly-line funk of \"Touch the Sky\"-- plods with the same unending gangster greys that tanked recent albums from Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, and Mobb Deep. On the surface, the tracks display a factory-sealed freshness, but that machine-made precision quickly becomes monotonous, begging for something more raw and excitable. Curtis nails this sweet-spot only once, on the stadium-status \"I Get Money\", an adrenaline rush so pure it manages to revive 50's weary id for three and a half booming minutes. Unfortunately, it's not nearly enough.",

And, thanks to virtual portals like YouTube, these feats are now more widespread than ever, whether it's an old guy balancing himself on a bottle, or a dude eating 14 Twinkies in one minute, or producer Abraham Orellana aka AraabMuzik hitting his MPC sampler's pads at speeds that dazzle the eye. Commenting on a startling recent AraabMuzik live performance video, Pitchfork's Nate Patrin wrote, \"Every instrument needs its Buddy Rich.\" The comparison to one of the most inventive and renowned drummers of all time is apt: AraabMuzik uses the technology of today to inspire centuries-old awe.\nBut, without a proper frame, music virtuosity can easily fall into numbing indulgence. After making beats for a range of East Coast hip-hop acts including Dipset and fellow speedster Busta Rhymes, AraabMuzik's 2011 album Electronic Dream had him nailing an undiscovered niche. The LP found the producer ingeniously mixing his precision drums with airy trance samples and coming away with a haunting sound that was unique to him. That breakthrough has helped him graduate from the realm of underground rap to huge electronic music festivals; just last week he opened for EDM kingpin Skrillex at the 4,000-capacity Hollywood Palladium and he'll hit Coachella for the first time this April. And he's got ambitious plans for 2012, including an in-the-works collaborative album with A$AP Rocky, along with his Dream followup, Electronic Reality, studio time with Danny Brown, Theophilus London, and Skrillex, and hopes of working with pop's most elite players. And while the 22-year-old has left the hip-hop world behind him to an extent, on the phone he's an amusingly relentless self-promoter in the Diddy/Dame Dash mold, viewing the music industry as something to be conquered completely: \"People are going to be seeing me a lot everywhere: TVs, music, movies, festivals. You name it, I’m gonna be there.\"\nPitchfork: How did you make the transition from hip-hop to the dance world?\nAraabMuzik: I do it all. I'm not stuck strictly doing hip-hop. Songs from the dance/electronic scene are my favorite to make and remix, and I like that world. And they accepted me, which was big. I never thought I was going to perform at places like the Electric Daisy Carnival. I was doing regular clubs, beginner stuff, and then once I hooked up with a booking agent they got me in there. As a hip-hop artist originally, it's overwhelming for me to be on stage with these people and doing something that no one's really seen. It's a big step. And now, the game is pretty much merging into that style, so I made that move at the right time.\nWhat's crazy to me is that people now assume I'm behind [hip-hop] tracks that other people are putting out. They're just sitting on the edge of their chair waiting for me to put out [rap beats]. But it's not going to happen. I've graduated from that. All that hip-hop stuff is like play. Right now, I'm just focusing on doing major stuff, like stadiums. All that other stuff I can do on my down time. You want a beat? Alright, I'll help you out. Take this. I'll be in Australia doing something crazy like designing my own sneakers or my own energy drink, so people can feel like me when they drink it. \"Be like me on the MPC\" or something-- we should advertise it that way. You sell it. You're selling a product.\nWatch an Adidas commercial soundtracked by AraabMuzik:\nPitchfork: A lot of hip-hop is incorporating dance music sounds now anyway.\nAM: Yeah, that's all you hear. For a lot of people who are just starting to find out about this type of music, they're going to be like, \"Oh, he's doing this because it's popular now.\" No, I've been doing it. I saw someone label me as a dubstep producer-- which, I mean, thanks, but I'm definitely not a dubstep producer. There's nothing wrong with that, though, because that's major. But it's like a school bus driver being labeled as a NASCAR driver. I would love to be a NASCAR driver, but I drive buses for a living.\nPitchfork: How did you originally think to start sampling trance and really upbeat dance music?\nAM: [Alice DeeJay's \"Better Off Alone\"] sparked it. I used to hear those types of records on the radio. Then I just started digging and doing stuff with vocals and breakdowns and nice melodies, atmospheric-sounding stuff. Spacey music. If something catches my attention, I start chopping it up right there and then.\nPitchfork: Some of the dance songs you sample are really catchy but they can also be pretty annoying-- it takes a certain open-mindedness to flip those sorts of records.\nAM: Yeah, 'cause if you play hip-hop people this other style, they're like, [disgusted voice] \"What's that?\" But when I do it it's like, \"Damn, that was hot.\" If you were to play them the regular song by itself, they wouldn't be into it. People are scared to do stuff because they're worried about how people are going to look at them. But I liked [trance] regardless and just kept going. And look where I am now.\nPitchfork: You sampled the Deadmau5 and Kaskade song \"I Remember\" on the deluxe edition of Electronic Dream. Do you assume people listening to your version are already familiar with the original? Do you care?\nAM: I don't. People in the hip-hop world won't really know, but most of the [dance] people know it because that's a big record in that world. People like my version of \"I Remember\" better than the original now. And that's pretty much what I do: make stuff that's already hot even hotter. I reinvent shit. There are a lot of people who have used the same samples I've used, but there's no way they flipped it the way I did. So, when I put my version out, people completely forgot that this [other] person did it. Everyone can have the same product, but it's more about the way you present it and put it together.\nI don't just strictly sample. I build. I'm a musician: I play piano and drums, I read notes, I write music. All of that's incorporated into Electronic Dream, but I just make it seem like it's part of the record I got it from. The world just sees me as being on MPCs, but this year I'm gonna start letting people know I'm like an orchestra: one hand on the piano, another hand on the MPC, another hand on the drums, another on the phone.\nI've been producing since the age of 12 and got my first MPC in 2006. I'd been doing a lot of keyboard recording on tapes for years, just filling up the 90-minute Maxwell tapes full of beats. Then I started making a lot of beats on programs, but I always brought my own drum kit everywhere I went, so I could use my sounds instead of the stock sounds. I always try to find a way to incorporate my own sounds. And that's when I got introduced to the MPC. I've went through a lot of MPCs. I own five or six. At Coachella, I might perform with four.\nPitchfork: Do you personally listen to artists like Deadmau5?\nAM: Yeah, I've been listening to all that for years-- that's why it's so good when I do it. It's funny, I'm always blowing the speakers out in studios, like, there's smoke coming out of them. I found out that I'm not built for studio monitors. I record and mix down everything in the headphones and then I bring it to the speakers. People always wonder: What do you use to mix? I mix everything with MPC-- EQing, panning, everything. I don't use software.\nIt's always been live since day one. The way you see me now is the way I was doing it when I first got the MPC. Obviously, not as fast and accurate-- it took years to perfect the skill-- but I always had it. I'm a drummer. I've been playing since I was three. I was in college bands when I was in elementary school: you'd see all these older kids and then this little kid behind the drums creating this big sound.\nPitchfork: Do you practice with the MPC a lot?\nAM: Definitely not. No, no, no. I don't practice. It's a gift. It's talent. Obviously, I do it all the time so it's like I'm practicing, but that's just what I do. Sometimes I'll be in the studio flipping through beats and I'll do something quick and people will be like, \"What the?!\" It's natural! I don't need to be nice like that, I just do it. When I'm in the studio with people who don't really know what I can do with the MPC, I'll pull the machine out and they'll be like, \"Oh, damn! I haven't seen one of those in years! What are you about to do? You don't got no CDs in there?\" And then: boom. That's how that video with me and Busta Rhymes in the studio came about:\nThat was the first time I met him. He couldn't believe it! He literally just got up and put me in a headlock and was like,\"What the fuck was that?\" It was like he saw an alien. I am an alien. I start a lot of relationships these artists because of what I'm capable of doing with the machine and with beats. Anyone can just listen to a beat, that's boring. But when you actually perform in front of them, it's like: wow. It's undeniable talent. That's my advantage.\nThe first time I flew out to L.A. to meet 50 Cent, I went to go meet up with him in the studio and the first thing he said was, \"Are you ready?\" And in my head, I'm like, \"Are you ready?\" He wasn't ready! The beat I was playing was too much for him. He couldn't finish the record. Literally. He took the headphones off and was like, \"Yo, this beat's too much for me. I'm gonna have to finish this tomorrow.\"\nPitchfork: What artists would you like to work with this year?\nAM: I've worked with a handful of people, but they're pretty much all East Coast. So I want to get to the South: T.I., Jeezy, Waka, Lil Wayne. I don't want my music to stay New York, I want it to be everywhere. If I'm in Taiwan, I want to hear my music on the radio. I want to produce with people that are going to be on the charts and win Grammys because having regular old street songs is cool, but I did all that already. I want to be hearing myself on commercials for a new Mercedes-Benz. That's where I'm headed.\nWatch AraabMuzik's mind-boggling take on Skrillex's remix of Benny Benassi's \"Cinema\" live at a show in Warsaw, Poland:\nPitchfork: Skrillex is nominated for a bunch of Grammys this year-- that could be you next year.\nAM: Yeah! I mean, that live video from Warsaw was the biggest clip I ever put out. Two days after it went up, it was already at like 300,000 views. I was like, \"Damn!\" It's the one that got everyone's attention. Now people want to see that for themselves. And since I'm chopping up a Skrillex record in that video, me doing Skrillex is what's going to be huge. People are gonna want to book us together. Same with me an A$AP. I sell out shows, he sells out shows. Us together? [laughs] There you go.\nPitchfork: The best part of that video is watching the dude in the glasses in the background react like he just saw his dead grandfather come back to life.\nAM: [laughs] Yeah. People want to see more. For my next show with Skrillex I'm gonna give the people new techniques. You know how Skrillex got the little alien thing behind him when he performs? I might do a backflip or pull an extra arm out of nowhere. Who knows? Nowadays, all the people who are major are just DJs. The lighting and all that makes the show-- without all of that stuff, it's just a person behind a laptop. With me, though, it's an actual show. Like, I'm doing that. If I stop, the music stops. With me having cameras and projectors and all kinds of crazy lighting at the same time, it would be like too much for people to take.\nPitchfork: Are you talking to any big pop stars about producing their records?\nAM: Not at the moment. I'm going to get there. I'm just one beat away. That's what I keep telling myself. But I'm good. It's all about timing. I don't rush nothing. I don't force anything. I still see myself as the underdog.\nWatch AraabMuzik perform on Pitchfork.tv's \"Surveillance\":",

      "content": "---\ntitle: Damian \"Jr. Gong\" Marley\nauthor: Tom Breihan\nurl: https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/6138-damian-jr-gong-marley/\nhostname: pitchfork.com\ndescription: \"Welcome to Jamrock\" is more than a summer jam; it's the sort of song that fills the air until ...\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2005-09-10\ncategories: ['features']\n---\n\"Welcome to Jamrock\" is more than a summer jam; it's the sort of song that fills the air until you're breathing it, that starts playing itself over in your head when you're trying to fall asleep, and it's nothing short of miraculous that a blast of pure gravelly disdain like this has become an honest-to-god hit. Over a sparse, clanking, one-drop reggae beat and an old Ini Kamoze sample (\"Out in the streets, they call it muuurdeeeer\"), Damian \"Jr. Gong\" Marley, youngest son of Bob, roars righteous rage at tourists sitting on beaches in Jamaica while people starve and kids shoot each other a few miles away.\n\"Jamrock\" might be Marley's biggest hit to date, but he's already had a fruitful career-- one Grammy and three albums-- and he's quick to correct any interviewer who might think that \"Jamrock\" is what he's all about. Pitchfork spoke with him in the conference room at his publicist's office in Manhattan as he and his crew smoked weed and drank Guinness.\nPitchfork: How do you feel about all the publicity you have to do now?\nMarley: Well, we've been doing it for some time now. With the success of the single, I'm a little more busy, doing more interviews, but it's not really anything new for us.\nPitchfork: It's really cool that \"Welcome to Jamrock\" is doing as well as it is right now because that song seems to be changing the way Americans are listening to music from other places. We've had dancehall hits before, but we haven't had anything as furious and as rough as what you did with that.\nMarley: I like the words you used to describe it, furious and rough. It's my luck to be at the frontier of what looks to be a resurrection of roots music on the international scene. That's really what reggae music is about, that voice against oppression and struggle.\nPitchfork: It doesn't sound anything like what your father did, which is what people would probably expect. It's got that digital 80s feel, like when the first dancehall was coming out, like Cutty Ranks or whatever.\nMarley: With a dub feel, like Sly and Robbie. It's when a lot of electronics started coming into dub, like drum triggering and stuff like that.\nPitchfork: It seems like that whole mid-old-school thing is just really getting huge now, not only with you but with I Wayne and the Jah Cure records that are coming out here,\nMarley: In Jamaica, them always have throwback riddims, recycled old beats, and the hardcore reggae scene is always present. You have faster stuff like the more commercialized stuff, but you always have that segment of music that is always from the core, from the original root of it. This year, you have seen a lot of it explode on the international scene. It's great. People are looking for something different. Maybe there was too much of one thing, and now they're looking for something fresh.\nPitchfork: Does it feel transient to you? Or do you think it's a permanent change to the way people are listening to reggae music?\nMarley: It's expanding. I think that with every great accomplishment we make as a genre our core market expands. I think reggae is growing.\nPitchfork: Is it weird for you seeing this song that you made, this angry song, on BET next to Omarion or whatever.\nMarley: No. We've been trying to reach there for a long time now. We've always wanted to be exposed on mainstream media, so it's satisfying.\nPitchfork: But is it strange that it happened with this song?\nMarley: If you want to look at it from a point of view that the media doesn't usually embrace songs like this, it would be strange. But it's not strange to me. It's refreshing and satisfying to me because we're being ourselves. We're not trying to come across as commercially acceptable. [But] it's not strange. It's a good feeling.\nPitchfork: With the video, it looks like it was shot with camcorders. But you grew up with money.\nMarley: Yeah, I'm comfortable.\nPitchfork: But compared to even a lot of the artists who are making glitzier videos and glitzier songs.\nMarley: You say I am richer than them?\nPitchfork: You probably grew up with more money.\nMarley: Yeah, I might have grown up more comfortably that a lot of them, but that does not necessarily affect the budget that we bring to the music. The video was made for Jamaica specifically. People love it, and that's why it's reached so far. It isn't like we're trying to take a cheap approach to having an international video.\nPitchfork: With the album, I kind of expected it to be like the I Wayne album, where it all seems to be going the same way musically. But you've got old-school American hip-hop and R&B on a lot of these tracks. What made you decide to go in so many different directions?\nMarley: That's how I've been doing my thing. I experiment in a lot of different genres. We're fans of different genres of music that reflect in our thing. We make music that we like to listen to. I'm a big fan of hip-hop, so it reflects in my approach.\nPitchfork: What are you listening to the most right now?\nMarley: I listen to a lot of the stuff that's out right now. This year so far, 50 Cent, I like his two albums. There are a lot of things that are going on internationally. I mean, I'm a fan of popular music.\nPitchfork: You've got Bobby Brown and Nas on the record. How'd you link up with them?\nMarley: We linked up with Bobby Brown because he was doing a scene for his show [\"Being Bobby Brown\"]. Somebody in his production crew was a friend of the family. When he came to do the scene, we were at the studio, and there was a song that we were playing at the time, so he just got on it.\nPitchfork: So he just met up with you to have it be on the show?\nMarley: Yeah, it was more for his TV show. And then Nas, we've been fans of his for a long time. In building that track Nas is on, we were already hearing it. So we reached out to him, and he came and blessed it. When we were putting it together, we were like, \"Yeah, this sounds like something that Nas would mash it up.\"\nPitchfork: Your album is coming out and you're playing these big New York shows right at a moment when tension about race and poverty in America is at a high, with these floods and people saying that the government has been slow to respond, and devoting resources that could have helped them to the war in Iraq. Do you have any thoughts on that?\nMarley: It's the same thoughts that I had five years ago or 10 years ago. We have people in positions that are there to create opportunity for the masses, and that seldom really happens. We're flying to the moon, but we still have people suffering. People need to look out for people first.\nPitchfork: Have you been paying attention to what's been going on with the floods?\nMarley: I was actually in Miami when the hurricane passed through, so I was there for a few days.\nPitchfork: What was it like?\nMarley: It's not the first time I've been in a hurricane; hurricanes pass through Jamaica all the while. There's a lot of rain, a lot of wind.\nPitchfork: Did you grow up in Jamaica or in Florida?\nMarley: Jamaica.\nPitchfork: What was your life like growing up?\nMarley: We were comfortable. I grew up in uptown Jamaica; I went to a rich school. I was raised by my mother and my stepfather; they made sure education came before anything. I had a good childhood, grew up spending time with my bigger brothers and sisters. My people are good people. I was exposed to a lot of different kinds of people and culture.\nPitchfork: Did you get to know Lauryn Hill when your brother was with her?\nMarley: Yeah, I know her.\nPitchfork: What's your impression of her?\nMarley: She's family.\nPitchfork: Do you think she's ever going to put out records again?\nMarley: Yeah.",
