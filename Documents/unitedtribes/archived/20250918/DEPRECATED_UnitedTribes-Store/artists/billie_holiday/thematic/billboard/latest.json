Now it's owned by Concord, which is benefiting from new films.\nThere’s a scene in The United States vs. Billie Holiday when the iconic jazz singer — played by Andra Day, a contender for best actress at the Academy Awards on April 25 — is dying in bed, contemplating her legacy. “He’s trying to control my estate,” she says of her abusive third husband, Louis McKay.\nWhen Holiday died in 1959 without a will — but with a roll of $50 bills strapped to her leg, as the story goes — McKay did end up inheriting her estate, including her recording royalties, rights to her image, her publishing to songs including “God Bless the Child” and “Fine and Mellow,” and her autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues. (McKay even served as an adviser on the film of the same name, in which he was flatteringly portrayed by Billy Dee Williams.) And when McKay died of a heart attack in 1981, Holiday’s estate went to his heirs, including his widow, Bernice McKay, who in 2012 sold it to the independent publisher Bicycle Music — which three years later merged with Concord Music Group.\nTrending on Billboard\n“It’s not right that someone who was as awful to Billie Holiday as Louis McKay was would then have control of her likeness and her money,” says Danyel Smith, a former Billboard editor whose Shine Bright: A Personal History of Black Women In Pop is due early next year. “And it’s insane, at the end of the day, control of her money and likeness is in the hands of people who didn’t know her or have a relationship with her.”\nThe last year has been unusually active for Holiday’s estate. She’s the subject of two movies: The United States vs. Billie Holiday, plus the Billie documentary that started streaming on-demand in December. Her haunting recording of the civil rights classic “Strange Fruit” took off during last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests, growing from 3.5 million U.S. streams in 2018 to 5.2 million in 2020, according to MRC Data. Since Holiday was primarily a singer and never owned her recordings, most of the value of her estate lies in the name and likeness rights that movie producers usually need to make a film. And at a time when publishing assets have increased in value, investors like Irving Azoff’s Iconic Music Group have entered this market.\nAs the owner of Holiday’s estate, Concord has an interest in protecting her legacy. “We’re not here to change her story,” says Michele Smith, Concord’s vp of estate and legacy brand management. “We’re here to shine a light on the parts of her story that the world has failed to recognize.”\nExperts see unlimited potential in the Holiday estate, even with relatively minimal publishing revenue. Travis Cloyd, a Florida International University futurist in residence who specializes in virtual-reality projects, says holograms and other high-tech ventures “open up the doors to a lot of these historical figures having new ways of storytelling.” Jeff Jampol, who manages the estates of the Doors, Janis Joplin and others, likens “Strange Fruit” to Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech and Sam Cooke‘s “A Change Is Gonna Come” as an eternal civil-rights Black Lives Matter anthem. “It’s a seminal moment that has resonated around the world for decades,” he says. “And she is f—ing cool! You can take that dormant power and put it back in the pop conversation in a way that’s relevant to 14-year-olds.”\nAt the same time, Holiday’s posthumous loss of control over her work and legacy has been a cautionary tale for other major artists. “It’s painful to read that she died with a few pennies in her bank account,” says Jay Cooper, a music attorney who represents the estates of Etta James, Glen Campbell and John Denver. “She had a life of tragedy, and she had an afterlife of tragedy.”\nThis article originally appeared in the April 24, 2021 issue of Billboard.",

Watch.\nsitename: Billboard\ndate: 2021-02-23\ncategories: ['TV/Film']\ntags: ['bbnews, movies']\n---\nAndra Day endured “a pretty wild journey” to portray Billie Holiday, which included intense weight loss as well as new smoking and drinking habits.\nHer titular role in the upcoming biopic The United States vs. Billie Holiday, which will premiere on Hulu Friday (Feb. 26), peels back the curtain on the legendary jazz singer’s declining physical health during the ’50s. To portray the “Strange Fruit” singer’s heavy drinking and heroin addiction on screen, Day took some off-screen measures of her own that she doesn’t recommend in order to obtain a “period body” that was accurate for the time the film was set in.\n“There was the drastic weight loss. So I was originally 163 when I started. I got down to 124. I don’t necessarily recommend,” she explained to W Magazine in a new interview Tuesday (Feb. 23). “For me, it was like I didn’t want my body to look like a gym body of 2020, or 2019 at the time. For me, it was important having a period body. The other thing is it made me very weak on set and slowed me down in a way that really helped with the heroin.”\nThe 36-year-old Grammy-nominated singer has already snagged two Golden Globe nominations this year for best performance by an actress in a motion picture (drama) and best song in a motion picture for her performance of “Tigress & Tweed.” She earned similar nods for the 2021 Critics Choice Awards, including best actress and best song. But as “nerve-racking” as it was to consistently emulate the voice of one of her idols, she went through much more rigorous training to physically stay in character.\nTrending on Billboard\n“I started smoking cigarettes, which I don’t do. I don’t smoke anything. First of all, I have no frame of reference for myself smoking, so it makes me feel like her. It slows me down. She’s like molasses — I’m very fast. And when I had to do scenes where I was high on heroin, it really helped my physical body to nod in a way that I was just focusing on the emotion,” Day continued. “And I don’t drink alcohol, but I did drink a lot of gin and bourbon and all of that stuff, even though you’re really not supposed to do that.”\nDay told W Magazine that she also had to pick up cursing. Even though it completely took her out of her element, she was more than willing to play the part right.\n“Look, I was desperate. I didn’t want to be terrible, so I was like, ‘Whatever we have to do in this moment, for this role. Cut off all my hair,'” she said.\nWatch her W Magazine video interview below.",

Davis, who has already won an Oscar, Emmy and Tony, seems to have a better chance of being nominated, with Day currently seen as likely to finish just outside the top five.\nTrending on Billboard\nIf Day is nominated, this would be the second portrayal of Holiday to be recognized in that category. Diana Ross’ performance in Lady Sings the Blues received a 1972 nomination. This would make Holiday the first musical performer to inspire two Oscar-nominated portrayals.\nThe late Chadwick Boseman is also considered a sure thing to receive a best actor nomination for his role as Levee, an arrogant trumpet and cornet player in Rainey’s band, but that character is fictional.\nIn each of the last two years, actors won Oscars in lead categories for their portrayals of music legends. Last year, Renée Zellweger won best actress for playing Judy Garland. Two years ago, Rami Malek won best actor for playing Freddie Mercury of Queen.\nCooke, Holiday and Rainey have long been recognized as musical giants.\nIn 1986, Cooke became one of the 10 original artists inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four years later, Rainey became the second female artist — following fellow blues legend Bessie Smith — to be inducted as an early influence. Holiday was honored as an early influence in 2000.\nHoliday and Cooke have both received lifetime achievement awards from the Recording Academy: in 1987 and 1999, respectively. Rainey has not received that top honor yet. But all three artists have recordings in the Grammy Hall of Fame.\nAll three of these figures died before their time, which, of course, adds to the drama of their lives. Cooke was just 33 in 1964 when he was shot and killed by the manager of a motel in Los Angeles. Holiday died of cirrhosis at age 44 in 1959. Rainey died of a heart attack at age 53 in 1939.\nHere’s a concise look at these performers.\nMa Rainey: Rainey, born Gertrude Malissa Pridgett in Columbus, Ga., released “See See Rider Blues” in 1925. The track featured Louis Armstrong on cornet and Fletcher Henderson on piano. It was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2004. The song has been revived many times as “See See Rider” or “C.C. Rider.” A version by Eric Burdon and the Animals reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1966.\nRainey is also remembered for “Countin’ the Blues” (1924) and “Prove It on Me Blues” (1928).\nRainey’s life inspired August Wilson’s play Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. A 1984-85 Broadway run received three Tony nominations, including best play.\nBillie Holiday: Holiday, born Eleanor Gough in Philadelphia, landed her first hits with Teddy Wilson and his Orchestra in 1935, before going out on her own the following year. She has nine recordings in the Grammy Hall of Fame, which puts her in a tie with Ella Fitzgerald as the woman with the most entries. Holiday’s nine Hall of Fame entries are “My Man” (1937), “Strange Fruit” (1939), “God Bless the Child” (1941), “Solitude” (1941), “Embraceable You” (1944), “Lover Man (Oh Where Can You Be)” (1945), “Crazy He Calls Me” (1949), Lady Sings the Blues (1956) and Lady in Satin (1958).\nHoliday never had a smash album, though the soundtrack to Ross’ Lady Sings the Blues (which borrowed the title of Holiday’s aforementioned 1956 album) topped the Billboard 200 for two weeks in 1973. In 2000, Ross inducted Holiday into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Ross opened with an a cappella performance of “Strange Fruit” and later also performed “God Bless the Child.”\nAudra McDonald won a 2014 Tony for best actress in a play for portraying Holiday in Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar & Grill.\nSam Cooke: Cooke, born Samuel Cook (without the “e”) in Clarksdale, Miss., was the lead singer of The Soul Stirrers from 1950-56. Cooke landed his biggest hit, “You Send Me,” in 1957, before the inception of the Hot 100. He had four top 10 hits on the Hot 100 in the 1960s: “Chain Gang,” “Twistin’ the Night Away,” “Another Saturday Night” and the posthumous hit “Shake.”\nCooke landed six Grammy nominations, but never won a Grammy in competition. (Bear in mind that his biggest hit, “You Send Me,” was released the year before the inception of the Grammys, which, like the Hot 100, launched in 1958.)\nCooke has four songs in the Grammy Hall of Fame (which is open to all recordings that are at least 25 years old): “You Send Me,” “Wonderful World” (1960), “Bring It On Home to Me” (1962, with Lou Rawls on backing vocal) and “A Change Is Gonna Come” (1965). “A Change Is Gonna Come” was released as the B-side of Cooke’s hit “Shake,” though it’s considered far more of a classic than the A-side.\nCooke had three top 30 albums on the Billboard 200: Sam Cooke (No. 16 in 1958), The Best of Sam Cooke (No. 22 in 1962) and the classic live album Sam Cooke at the Copa (No. 29 in 1964).\nIn addition to the portrayals of Garland and Mercury that received Oscars in the last two years, nine other portrayals of real-life music personalities — both legends and lesser-known figures — have been honored over the years. The others are Mahershala Ali as Don Shirley in Green Book (2018), Marion Cotillard as Edith Piaf in La Vie En Rose (2007), Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash in Walk the Line (2005), Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles in Ray (2004), Geoffrey Rush as Australian pianist David Helfgott in Shine (1996), F. Murray Abraham as Mozart’s rival Antonio Salieri in Amadeus (1984), Sissy Spacek as Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner’s Daughter (1980), Barbra Streisand as Fanny Brice in Funny Girl (1968), and James Cagney as George M. Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942).",

But in his new movie, The United States vs Billie Holiday, starring Andra Day, Lee Daniels shines a light on that facet of the jazz singer’s story, in which Holiday’s 1939 song about lynching, “Strange Fruit,” made her a target of the FBI.\n“When you think of Civil Rights leaders, you think of men,” Daniels says. “When you think of Billie Holiday, you think of this brilliant tortured jazz singer that happened to have been a drug addict. I didn’t know that she kicked off the Civil Rights movement. Before there was a Civil Rights movement, there was Billie Holiday and ‘Strange Fruit.’ The government saw that song as a threat and she was a target. That’s history and they keep it from us.”\nTrending on Billboard\nPlaywright and screenwriter Suzan-Lori Parks adapted The United States vs Billie Holiday from Johan Hari’s 2015 book about the war on drugs, Chasing the Scream, and the film, which will debut on Hulu in February, depicts the U.S. government’s pursuit of Holiday for her heroin use in the context of the FBI’s efforts to suppress her performance of “Strange Fruit,” which the government feared would galvanize the anger of Black Americans.\nDay, in her first significant acting role, appears opposite Trevante Rhodes, who plays a mysterious figure who surfaces backstage one night and turns out to have more complicated motivations than those of a mere fan. Garrett Hedlund is Harry Anslinger, the leader of the FBI’s anti-drug efforts, who is targeting Holiday, and Natasha Lyonne (as Tallulah Bankhead) and Da’Vine Joy Randolph are women in Holiday’s vibrant circle of friends and lovers.\nFor Daniels, who collected best picture and best director Oscar nominations for his 2009 film Precious: Based on the Novel “Push” by Sapphire, and who produced 2001’s Monster’s Ball, the 1972 Diana Ross/Billy Dee Williams film about Billie Holiday, Lady Sings the Blues, had been formative. “At 13 years old, I saw [Lady Sings the Blues] in Philadelphia and I saw two Black people in love, Diana Ross and Billy Dee Williams,” says Daniels, now 61. “They were beautiful, stunning. That fashion was fabulous. It was everything that I grew up about as an inner-city kid in Philly, except it was in Harlem and it just reeked of my life. I had never seen anything like it ever. That was the reason why I ended up directing, which is weird because I ended up directing her story, but it wasn’t a story. It was a lie. It was make believe.” Where the 1972 film was a romanticized portrait of Holiday’s relationship with her fourth husband and road manager, Louis McKay, who retained control of her estate, Daniels says, “I really wanted to show Black love that we don’t see very often — it’s flawed and messy, yet, it’s beautiful.”\nBefore he started on his film, Daniels says he called Motown record label founder Berry Gordy, who produced Lady Sings the Blues, to ask permission—and got it. “I don’t think I would have done the movie if he said, don’t do it,” Daniels says.\nEarly on several people, including Daniels’ manager and agents urged him to consider Day for the role, but he was resistant. “I don’t like being pressured into anything,” he says. But he took a meeting with Day “and she was enchanting and she did embody the spirit of Billie,” Daniels says. “I sent her to an acting coach because she had not acted before. And the acting coach, on the fly, turned her iPhone on and showed me her prepping and getting into character. Just from that 30 seconds of video footage, I saw Billie Holiday without question. The game was up. There was no acting. There was just being.” Day later sang “Strange Fruit” in a formal audition for Daniels, and her casting was sealed.\nThis article was originally published by The Hollywood Reporter.

Some have come out of nowhere, others have taken months to catch on, and all of them could become ubiquitous in the blink of a TikTok clip.\nThis week: Taylor Swift’s blockbuster Midnights bow comes with sparkling cross-platform numbers for its lead single and big gains for her back catalog, while Billie Holiday spawns an unlikely new TikTok trend and Halloween perennials begin to perk back up.\n‘Anti-Hero’ Already Saving the Day at Radio\nA new Taylor Swift album yielding a huge song debut on the Billboard Hot 100 in the week after its release shouldn’t be a surprise by now. After all, three of her previous four full-lengths — Folklore, Evermore, and the Taylor’s Version re-recording of Red — arrived with concurrent No. 1 bows on the Hot 100: “Cardigan,” “Willow” and “All Too Well (10-Minute Version)” each reached the top of the chart in their respective debut weeks. “Anti-Hero,” the lead single from latest Republic LP Midnights, has a great shot to both join those songs as another chart-topper for Swift – and surpass them all as her biggest chart hit in years.\nThat’s in large part because the slick, sardonic pop standout is off to an enormous start at radio, even compared to Swift’s last three No. 1 singles. “Anti-Hero” debuts on three radio charts — Pop Airplay (No. 23), Adult Pop Airplay (No. 19) and Adult Contemporary (No. 14) — after just three days of activity, from its Oct. 21 release through Sunday, Oct. 23. In those three days, “Anti-Hero” earned 16.1 million audience impressions from over 275 reporters to Billboard’s all-format Radio Songs chart, according to Luminate. Compare that to the 5.8 million impressions for “Willow” or the 4.7 million for “Cardigan” over their respective first three days — or the 286,000 of “All Too Well (Taylor’s Version)” across its full first week — and it’s clear that radio is very on board with Swift’s return to a more traditional pop sound.\nOf course, the quick radio start for “Anti-Hero” comes in addition to blockbuster streaming numbers — over 30 million U.S. on-demands in its first three days, according to Luminate. Add up all of the harbingers of its big commercial debut and “Anti-Hero” very comfortably can announce: It’s me, hi, it’s the smash single, it’s me. – JASON LIPSHUTZ\nTaylor Swift’s Back Catalog Soars, Before and After ‘Midnights’\nSpeaking of Swift’s streaming gains, the Oct. 21 release of Midnights was both preceded and followed by the superstar’s catalog earning renewed interest from fans eager to prepare themselves for the new album, then compare her latest opus to her others. After earning 56.9 million U.S. on-demand streams in the three days from Friday, Oct. 14, through Sunday, Oct. 16, according to Luminate, Swift’s catalog earned 64.6 million streams over the following three days – a 14% gain as Swifties celebrated the Midnights release week.\nOn Thursday, Oct. 20, the catalog jumped to 27.2 million daily streams — a 21% gain for Midnights Eve. And while Swift’s new album was the streaming focus for fans on the following day, they still clocked in nearly 23 million streams for her non-Midnights music last Friday, a 10% jump from the previous Friday. Swift turned the release of Midnights into a global event for fans, and they responded in kind by returning to their favorite older tracks in the days surrounding its unveiling. – JL\nOdd TikTok Trend Brings Billie Holiday’s “Solitude” to the Masses\n“Solitude” has a long history of re-popularizing itself. First, it was a popular recording by Duke Ellington in the 1930s; next, it reached its zenith with Billie Holiday’s rendition of the tune in 1952. More recently the tune was sung by Andra Day for the film the United States vs. Billie Holiday, and now it’s… become a meme on TikTok? While some users are still going back to the original Holiday audio, using the song to soundtrack cozy nights at home and baking videos, more videos come from a joke that the song has somehow inspired: users will go up to their friend, zooming in on old fashion-looking shoes they are wearing, saying, “oh s–t, they got the god d–n ‘in my solituuuude” (the “in my solitude” part sung in a mocking rendition of Holiday).\nRegardless of whether or not it’s disrespectful to the jazz standard or just plain un-funny to you, the meme has given the Verve-reissued Holiday version of the song a major boost on streaming. “Solitude” posted nearly 649,000 official on-demand U.S. streams for the week ending Oct. 20 – a gain of over 85% from the previous week, according to Luminate. – KRISTIN ROBINSON\n“Another” Bump for Tom Odell\nBritish singer-songwriter Tom Odell’s heartbreak ballad “Another Love” was a major hit throughout Europe upon its release on Columbia a decade ago, making it to the top 10 of the U.K.’s Official Charts in early 2013, even as it mostly missed the charts stateside. But the song has been steadily growing once again over the past year thanks largely to its popularity on TikTok, and now it’s nearly as big a hit once more as it ever was: The song hits No. 10 on Billboard’s Global Excl. US chart this week in its 81st week, breezing past Glass Animals’ “Heat Waves” for the longest-ever climb to the listing’s top 10.\nThe song is making waves over here this time, too: After climbing steadily in consumption for most of the past month, this week the song gets a more pronounced spike, gaining 19% to nearly 4 million in official on-demand U.S. streams for the week ending Oct. 20. The streaming activity sends the song to a new No. 19 peak on Billboard’s Hot Rock & Alternative Songs tally this week (chart dated Oct. 29), and even to No. 15 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. – ANDREW UNTERBERGER\nQ&A: Alex Tear, VP Pop Programming SiriusXM + Pandora, on What’s Trending Up in His World\nWith 2022 nearly in the books, what do you think we’ll consider as the biggest story in pop music this year by the time it ends?\nOne of the biggest stories for us this year is Harry’s House. From “As It Was” to “Late Night Talking” and “Music For A Sushi Restaurant,” our HITS 1 listeners continue to rank Harry at the top. Lizzo & Doja Cat’s pop presence also needs to be respected, from Lizzo’s No. 1 “About Damn Time” and “2 Be Loved” to Doja’s collab with Post Malone, “I Like You (A Happier Song),” and recent hit with “Vegas.”\nWhich songs could you foresee dominating the final few months of the year and pushing into the new year?\nWe’re so excited for Sam Smith and Kim Petras: “Unholy” has shook year-end according to our HITS 1 listeners. Rihanna’s “Lift Me Up” will close 2022 with a bang! Queen Bey’s “Cuff It” will also continue to do well and sounds great on SiriusXM.\nWho’s one artist who made noise in 2022 that you think could have an even bigger 2023?\nSam Smith and Beyoncé, while giving honorable mention to Lil Nas X for 2023. Rihanna will also roll into the new year with a commanding presence!\nFill in the blank: in 2023, more programmers should be paying attention to __________.\nKeeping the art and science present. The available resources to predict and measure music are abundant, it’s more important than ever to continue early human discovery to help shape, elevate, own and differentiate our brands with the next emerging artists. – J.L.\nSeason’s Gainings: Halloween Listening Starts Early\nWe hear a lot about how the Christmas season starts earlier every year – but before Mariah & Co. officially begin their takeover, we’re also seeing Spooky Season expanded well beyond the final week of October. Perennial Halloween favorites have been seeing huge gains since the end of September: Bobby “Boris” Pickett’s “Monster Mash” has gained from 654,000 official on-demand U.S. streams and 700 digital sales for the week ending Sept. 22 to over 2.4 million streams and 2,000 sales four weeks later (gains of 270% and 197%, respectively), according to Luminate, while Ray Parker Jr.’s “Ghostbusters” raised from just over one million streams and 300 sales to just over three million streams and 1,200 sales (up 188% and 247%, respectively).\nAnd then of course, there’s the daddy of them all: Michael Jackson’s “Thriller,” which has re-entered the Hot 100 in eight of the past nine Halloween seasons – making it all the way back to No. 19 last year. We’ll see if it has enough juice to beat that position this year (or even threaten its original No. 4 peak, set back in 1984), but it’s already up to 3.6 million in streams and 1,700 in sales, gains of 129% and 181% from four weeks earlier. – AU",
