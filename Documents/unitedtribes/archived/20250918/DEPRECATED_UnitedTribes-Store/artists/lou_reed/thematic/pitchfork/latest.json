Over the next three decades, Metal Machine Music fell out print, was re-anointed by burgeoning noise fiends, and, ultimately, remastered for a digital reissue. In 2002, Ulrick Krieger transcribed the album and arranged for it to be performed-- with Reed on guitar-- by Zeitkratzer, an 11-member classical ensemble. The concert was held at the MaerzMusik Haus Der Berliner Festspiele on March 17, 2002 and just released on CD (with an accompanying DVD) by San Francisco's Asphodel Records. Pitchfork talked to Reed about the performance, Tai Chi, and whether or not Metal Machine Music is anything more than an epic prank.\nLou Reed: Hello, hi. How are you, Amanda?\nPitchfork: I'm great.\nReed: How do you say your last name?\nPitchfork: Petrusich.\nReed: Wow. A name name. That's a real name. You should be a movie star. What nationality is it?\nPitchfork: It's Croatian.\nReed: It's a great, great name. Are you married? What's your husband's name?\nPitchfork: Stetka. Which is a Czech name.\nReed: What's it like when you say them both?\nPitchfork: Petrusich-Stetka.\nReed: That's pretty good, don't you think?\nPitchfork: It's not bad.\nReed: What if you got knighted? That would be pretty good.\nPitchfork: [laughs] I watched the DVD of the performance last night. The DVD is my favorite part-- watching these extremely focused musicians hunched over, attacking their instruments, it's so physical. Was that something you thought about-- the physicality of the work-- when you were first approached about a live performance?\nReed: Absolutely. If Metal Machine is anything, it's energy and physicality, and you should be able to physically feel it, and it takes a lot of energy to perform it. So when Ulrick Krieger, who's the guy who transcribed it for Zeitkratzer-- he's an independent musician, he plays with a lot of different bands-- he called and said, \"I want to do this, I've always loved the piece and I want to transcribe it.\" I said it can't be transcribed. It defies transcription. And he said, \"Well, you know, I've always loved this thing, I know I can do this, and I know we can play this. Let me transcribe a little bit of it and we'll record five or ten minutes of it and you listen to it and decide whether it's OK or not.\"\nSo he did and it was amazing. I just couldn't believe it, that he could do this. But he did.\nPitchfork: The idea of Metal Machine Music as a performance piece also makes sense, in a way, because I get the impression that the record was recorded live-- obviously there aren't any overdubs, any loops. How did Krieger's transcription change your own understanding of the work, if at all?\nReed: It was amazing to hear the pieces that he latched onto, as pit stops, or [as places] to take off from. There are a lot of things he could be listening to, and he picked this one or that one, and I found it fascinating-- what he was doing, his way of listening. It's an interesting question. There's a lot of ways [to listen], if you're gonna listen to it [at all]. But if you can't listen to it like that, like the way you just said, then it's just a mishmash of noise.\nBut if you go in, and you scope it, and put your attention here, there, wherever you think the fun is, then it has shape. And that's what he did. He took off from the same starting point I did, but [from there] it depends on how you focus it, because you could parlay it in a lot of different ways. It was obvious that he could really hear it, that he could notate this for real. He was really paying attention to the harmonics. I just didn't even realize that guys into the electronics had gotten that far. I really didn't know. Within the past couple of years, I've been meeting a lot of younger musicians, and they collect a lot of analog pedals, a lot of electro-harmonic stuff. And I'm like, \"Why are you doing this? How come you don't have the new versions?\" And they say, \"Well, the sound is really great on these old analog pedals.\" But they don't play guitars, they don't play keyboards, they play machines. And they all know. So they say \"Oh, on Metal Machine, there's this, this, and this.'' It's pretty astonishing to me.\nPitchfork: Well, accurately or inaccurately, Metal Machine Music is often credited as inspiring, in part, much of the contemporary avant-garde music scene-- noise, in particular. I know you've performed with Sonic Youth, who have obviously taken cues from Metal Machine Music, but do you listen to any younger, maybe more experimental, post-Sonic Youth noise bands? There's a whole, burgeoning movement of people who I think are really clearly inspired by this record.\nReed: You know, I hear a lot of that kind of stuff. I wouldn't presume to say, \"Oh, they've been listening to Metal Machine.\" But on the other hand, sometimes I hear something and it's-- that kind of feedback, that kind of aggression, that kind of ripping guitar-- and I say well, that sounds familiar! I know who did that-- who does do that. I mean, I still do that. I liked it then and I love it now. I'm still involved in that kind of thing. And I really, really like it. I get a kick out of it. It requires a certain kind of energy that young people have.\n__\nPitchfork:__ It requires a certain energy from the audience, too.\nReed: Well, the thing is coming at you. But, you know, it's friendly.\nPitchfork: On 2003's The Raven, you included a white noise track called \"Fire Music\", and...\nReed: Aren't you smart! Yes, I did. It's a direct descendent.\n__\nPitchfork:__ ...And then this year, you released Hudson River Wind Meditations, which many have described as both antithetical to and an extension of Metal Machine Music. Are you finding yourself less and less interested in traditional verse-chorus-verse songwriting?\nReed: Funny you should ask that. \"Fire Music\" came after 9/11, and I was [living] just a couple of blocks from [Ground Zero]. And I was talking to some gearheads, some tech guys-- I wanted to know if you could do certain things that I was able to do on Metal Machine because it was analog. In digital, they said, \"You can do this, you can do that, but you can't do that, it will lose punch. You could technically do that, but it wouldn't sound too great.\" I thought that was kind of fascinating. So I wanted to do this little piece with a Metal Machine approach. It's only two or three minute long. That's \"Fire Music\".\n\"Fire Music\" just kills me. We mastered it...if you ever get to hear it on a big system, cause it's only two or three minutes long, but that thing, about two-thirds of the way through, rises up and advances out of the speakers, and I swear to you, it is amazing. I was up at [producer] Bob Ludwig's where he listening on these huge, God knows what...and that thing just rises up like this huge sonic wave, it's amazing. If there wasn't a wall to catch you, you'd still be heading south! It's just so astonishing. I started doing this other kind of music, and I was running these programs through guitar pedals. And it wasn't meant for guitar pedals. I found out lots of people do that.\nBut that's what I was doing, and that led into what became Hudson River Wind Meditations. That happened because I started getting this sound, and I've tried to get the sound back, but I can't get it back-- it's the one on the record, but I can't reproduce it. I was using some stuff by Line 6, and I don't know, coupled with a virus. I'm not sure what exactly did it, but I've never been able to get it back, because I didn't write it down and it wasn't MIDIed. But I had this thing and I really loved it and it was really good for meditation, it was really good for doing certain physical workouts, like Tai Chi. I took it to my class and the class liked it so we kept it there and used it. I would practice my routine to it. And I also did meditation to it. And then some people said, \"Can we borrow that thing?\" and I thought OK, I will move out of the rock thing because I don't want rock people thinking that there are rock'n'roll songs here, like they did with Metal Machine Music. It's for someone who wants it and knows what it is.\nBut you know, \"Fire Music\", I hadn't gone back to Metal Machine in a long time, but on The Raven, there are all these little electronic pieces in between the songs, and that built up to \"Fire Music\". I've got another one that I've got that I haven't released. It's the other side of the meditation music, it's called Purity. It's really amazing.\nPitchfork: Is it similar to the Hudson River songs?\nReed: It's the aggressive side of it.\nPitchfork: And you're releasing it?\nReed: I do want to release it. It really comes at you. I like music that comes at you.\nPitchfork: Me too.\nReed: What can you do?\n__\nPitchfork:__ It's a critical clich√©, but plenty have said, retrospectively, that Metal Machine Music was released ahead of its time-- it was reissued in 2000, and then performed in 2002, and now released as a live record in 2007. Do you think 2007 is its time?\nReed: I did [the live record] because I really loved it and I got a chance to work with these great musicians again, and we all had a great time doing it. I know that young kids out there find this music on their own. And they take it in the spirit in which it's done. I don't expect a lot of people to go for it, but I think there are some people who will get a lot of pleasure out of it.\nPitchfork: There's always been considerable chatter about whether or not Metal Machine Music was intended as a joke, or a stab at the record industry-- do you think the continuing conjecture about your intentions for the record is, now, as much a part of the art as the music?\nReed: The myth-- depends on how you look at it, but the myth is sort of better than the truth. The myth is that I made it to get out of a recording contract. OK, but the truth is that I wouldn't do that, because I wouldn't want you to buy a record that I didn't really like, that I was just trying to do a legal thing with. I wouldn't do something like that. The truth is that I really, really, really loved it. I was in a position where I could have it come out. I just didn't want it to come out and have the audience think it was more rock songs. It was only on the market for three weeks anyway. Then they took it away.\nPitchfork: Right, I read that it was the most returned record at that time...\nReed: It still may be the all-time champ.\nPitchfork: Do you think the critical and commercial response would have been different if it had been released on a classical label or an avant-garde label?\nReed: I haven't a clue. I tried to have it released on the classical label at RCA. And on it, it says \"An Electronic Composition\". That means no words.\n__\nPitchfork:__ Plus it's got that cover...\nReed: That's a rock'n'roll cover, that's for sure.\n__\nPitchfork:__ As a songwriter in 1975, what kinds of contextual or personal cues made you want to experiment with things like drone, volume, and sustained sound?\nReed: In the Velvet Underground, my guitar solos were always feedback solos, so it wasn't that big of a leap to say I want to do something that's nothing but guitar feedback, that doesn't have a steady beat and doesn't have a key. All we have to do is just have fun on the guitar, you don't have to worry about key and tempo. We just had tons of feedback and melody and licks flying around all over the place. I had two huge amps, and I would take two guitars and tune them a certain way and lean them against the amps so they would start feeding back. And once they started feeding back, both of them, their sounds would collide and that would produce a third sound, and then that would start feeding and causing another one and another one, and I would play along with all of them.\n__\nPitchfork:__ Earlier this summer, you toured with your 1973 album Berlin. How have these opportunities to revisit old work-- to place it in a new context, to reexamine and recreate-- affected you?\nReed: I think it's amazing to have the opportunity to do things like that.\n__\nPitchfork:__ To bring those records to new generations of people?\nReed: Well, a new generation, or maybe two new generations. I'm not sure how many years a generation is. I don't know if it's 10 or 20 years, I'm not sure. But if Berlin was 1973 and Metal Machine was '75 and now it's 2007, that's more than 30 years, so maybe it's a generation and a half. I think it's a real honor to be able to take these things out there and let people hear them.\n__\nPitchfork:__ Both of those records were skewered, critically, on their release.\nReed: They didn't have much of a chance. Out they came and away they went.\n__\nPitchfork:__ Were you anxious about Metal Machine Music's initial release? You must have had some sense that it was going to be shocking to people who bought and loved \"Walk on the Wild Side\" or \"Sweet Jane\".\nReed: I honestly thought \"Boy, people who like guitar feedback are gonna go crazy for this.\" Count me among them. If you like loud guitars, here we are.\n__\nPitchfork:__ Has it been interesting to see bands appropriate the idea of feedback as art, or feedback as its own instrument? I imagine it has to be gratifying to see that happen.\nReed: Feedback is a complete style of playing. People get better and better and better at it. Controlled feedback is really...I've devoted a lot of time to trying to do that. To have what I call the good harmonics, and avoid-- through electronics and the way the thing is built and the distance from the amp-- the bad harmonics. And also not go deaf while I was doing it. Because it used to be done by volume, and I thought, \"I'll go deaf doing it this way.\" So I met a guy named Pete Cornish. The idea was: how can I have a loud sound soft, so I don't go deaf? How can I do that kind of feedback? How can I get that kind of physicality going and not knock my own ears out while I'm at it? Because if the amp is offstage, then I don't have the distance to play around with the note. I have to be reasonably near the amp to be able to work with the feedback.\nPitchfork: You're currently collaborating with the Killers, and you've mentioned being a fan of Okkervil River-- are there any other new bands that you find particularly compelling?\nReed: I can't remember the names. There are lots of them. I would have to go into my iPod and look them up. But Okkervil River, sure. I like Amy Winehouse-- I hope everything's OK with her, but what a great song.\nPitchfork: And the stuff with the Killers...\nReed: That band is genuinely great. The thing we did, I think it's called \"Tranquilize\".\n__\nPitchfork:__ I know you have to go right now. Thanks so much for talking.\nReed: It's been a real pleasure talking to you, Amanda. Thank you.",

He began studying tai chi as part of an effort to get off speed and booze and strengthen his wrecked body as the 1970s drew to a close. An early teacher recalls Reed‚Äôs hands shaking so hard he could barely hold the positions, but he stuck with it. When he toured, he brought along his swords and instructional VHS tapes, practicing in hotel gyms and conference rooms; upon returning home he was known to take the taxi straight from the airport to class. In the final six years of his life, he intensified his focus, doing six days of tai chi followed by one day of yoga, week in and week out. Laurie Anderson, his partner of 21 years, said he was ‚Äúlooking for magic.‚Äù He was doing breathwork when he died, in fact‚Äîeyes wide open and hands in a tai chi position, with Anderson‚Äôs arms around him.\nNewly remastered and reissued with extensive liner notes by Light in the Attic, Hudson River Wind Meditations was first released in 2007, on a small Louisville, Colorado, label specializing in self-help and spirituality. But in the beginning, it wasn‚Äôt meant for public consumption at all. According to Anderson, Reed made early versions of these pieces to accompany guided meditations recited by Shelley Peng, an herbalist and acupuncturist. The music eventually morphed into a soundtrack for his tai chi practice, although not all his classmates were on board. Some fellow students preferred the traditional Chinese music that their teacher, Master Ren GuangYi, typically played, and asked for Reed‚Äôs tape to be turned off. One student walked out the door and never came back. (Reed‚Äôs drone music always did have a polarizing effect on listeners.)\nBut Reed and Ren kept playing the tape, and according to Anderson, anyway, some of his classmates eventually came around, saying that it was the best tai chi music they‚Äôd ever heard. One wonders to what extent Reed‚Äôs fame‚Äîor perhaps simply his legendary stubbornness‚Äîgreased the wheels. In an amusing anecdote in the liner notes, yoga instructor Eddie Stern says that when he worked with Reed, ‚ÄúWhether we were doing yoga or meditating, the Hudson River Wind Meditations came on, and even though I am a silent meditator and don‚Äôt normally recommend listening to music when meditating, I would let it slide for Lou.‚Äù\nThe bulk of the release is taken up by two long tracks offering markedly different visions of what ambient music could be. The opening ‚ÄúMove Your Heart‚Äù is the more minimal of the two. It consists of a single oscillating tone, or cluster of tones, that opens and closes, over and over, for nearly 29 minutes, with very little evident variation. Rooted in a bassy throb, it begins throwing off sparks as a growling, high-resonance filter combs through the frequencies; for a brief moment, it‚Äôs a softly reassuring major triad, and then the filter clamps down once again, grinding everything into the rumbling muck. The cycle moves like waves, or breathing, yet despite its seeming steadiness, the repetition is never quite exact, and that almost imperceptible sense of uncertainty heightens its power. You never know quite what the music is going to do next, even though it never really does anything. It‚Äôs calming yet never fully subdued: The piece seems to move with a life of its own, and its raw, unburnished sonics feel far away from the politeness of more placid relaxation music. At times, as the bass tones thicken and congeal, it feels downright unruly.",

After the gay-rights-rallying cry of Transformer in 1972, he spent a decade mating queerness with rockn‚Äôroll and flirting with his own homosexuality in public statements, an identity that seemed to culminate in 1979, when he came out to Creem Magazine. Hardly a year later, he was celebrating married love on Growing Up in Public and, by 1982, heterosexuality in more general terms on the nonetheless excellent The Blue Mask. Reed‚Äôs subject matter changed because his life did‚Äîhe got married in 1980‚Äîyet his newfound pop persona as a successful heterosexual capitalist coincided with the rise of Ronald Reagan, who was murdering gay people with his refusal to acknowledge the AIDS epidemic while helping to make greed and white-collar success culturally ubiquitous. Reed never supported Reagan‚Äôs policies, but he gave the impression of a star wearing the garb of his own era, scrawling an ode to his New Jersey country home as easily as he once caked on glam rock make-up. And then he made New York, a record of unmistakable conviction, one so direct and literary, erudite and rageful that it resembles no protest music written before or since.\nReleased in January of 1989, days before George H.W. Bush‚Äôs inauguration, New York treats straightforward hard rock and clean-toned, mesmeric guitar as blank pages on which to lay down a series of news stories, urban setpieces, and liberal-minded principles. Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani appear in its hyperdense lyrics‚Äîgleefully, Reed subjects both to horrific calamities. He once stated that he wanted to write ‚Äúthe Great American Novel‚Äù using ‚Äúthe rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll song as a vehicle,\" and on New York, the directive feels apt rather than pretentious. The city of his birth becomes his Yoknapatawpha County, a location for synecdoches that encompass large swatches of experience. Like much great fiction, Reed‚Äôs handling of his themes‚Äîa depleted environment, indigenous persecution, pro-lifers, police killings, racial violence‚Äîhas aged into greater relevance today.\nThough Reagan is never named, New York is nonetheless a dispatch from the fear-ridden two terms of our 40th president, an album that touches on aspects of the ‚Äò80s ignored by the era‚Äôs major-label music. Prince, Cyndi Lauper, and Reed himself worked HIV/AIDS into earlier songs, yet those few instances shied away from connecting the epidemic to the gay community. ‚ÄúHalloween Parade‚Äù uses the eponymous West Village tradition to show the hole that AIDS left in queer life:",

The truth is it is the product of genuine love and passion, still exhilarating and bursting with possibility four decades on.\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2017-12-03\ntags: ['sunday review']\n---\nIt‚Äôs all there in the first minute: there‚Äôs a low-mid whoosh that‚Äôs clearly guitar feedback, like a Jimi Hendrix power chord trailing off; there‚Äôs a bit of an electric rattle, perhaps a fluttering speaker cone gasping for air; then come the high-pitched screeches, perhaps bringing to mind a grainy video image of seagulls circling over an open sea filled with radioactive garbage. From there, a ringing squall is folded in, an unstable mess of harmonics that shudders and quakes like nerve impulses curling down a human spine. And with that, we‚Äôre deep into Lou Reed‚Äôs Metal Machine Music.\nFor a good 15 years after its 1975 release, Metal Machine Music, a double album of avant-garde noise put out by a rock legend who was only starting to get his commercial due, was discussed as a gesture more than as music. Explanations for its existence proliferated. Some said it was Lou Reed‚Äôs attempt to get out of a record contract, or a fuck-you to fans who only wanted to hear his most popular songs. Or it was mis-packaged, maybe, and was originally supposed to come out on a classical label, where there was some precedence for this kind of experiment. And some of these rumors about Metal Machine Music‚Äôs troubled release were started, or at least encouraged, by Reed himself.\nReed put out MMM at a precarious moment in his career, with VU firmly in the rearview but his own commercial prospects unclear. His 1972 debut solo album made almost no impact, but the David Bowie-produced Transformer fared much better with the rise of glam rock and the commercial success of the single ‚ÄúWalk on the Wild Side.‚Äù Though Reed followed that album with a poorly received commercial bomb (1973‚Äôs Berlin, now considered a theatrical rock classic), his profile in the rock world continued to climb through ‚Äô74 and ‚Äô75, and his past suddenly had currency. The Velvet Underground vault recording 1969 Velvet Underground Live with Lou Reed appeared in 1974, and the successful live solo album from earlier the same year, Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Animal, was heavy on glammed-up versions of VU songs. Sally Can‚Äôt Dance wasn‚Äôt one of Reed‚Äôs better albums, but the title song got some FM radio play, and the LP hit the Top 10. Given his dicey commercial prospects at the beginning of the decade, Reed could, by mid‚Äì1975, be called a successful rock star. Which explains why his next choice was so baffling.",

The album realigned Reed with the punk and new/no wave movements he helped sire, and it was helped into the canon by Reed's strongest (and most heart-wrenching) batch of songs in years.\nBut 30 years on, it's hard to hear The Blue Mask as sonically assaultive so much as brutally personal, in a way that's got less to do with guitar dissonance than Reed's fearless self-laceration. Not since \"Heroin\" had Reed written a song as harrowing as \"The Blue Mask\", where the lyrics have the hideous specificity of a newly sober man unleashing a lot of backed-up self-examination. 1983's Legendary Hearts-- which reassembles most of the Blue Mask band, swapping drummer Fred Maher for Doane Perry-- is fleeter and funnier where the previous album ground down at its themes. It's playful without being indulgent, the kind of record hardcore fans come to treasure because it proves that even their hero's second-tier efforts, the ones that get passed over when they're not starred in the record guides, can hide secret charms.\nWhat impresses 27 years on is Reed's range: \"Don't Talk to Me About Work\" is a nasty little one-note jab at 9-to-5 drudgery, akin to the gags that littered early Replacements albums (albeit way more literate, as you'd expect). But it's followed by \"Make Up Mind\", a ballad as tender as anything on The Velvet Underground, Reed and Quine feeding each other little bursts and swells of melody as the bass and drums keep heartbeat time. That range sometimes gets him into trouble, however. Reed's voice-- an instrument suited to, well, Lou Reed songs and very little else-- remains the most divisive component of his music. New listeners, or those not already charmed by his penchant for stretching his monotone sing-song via dramatic hops down an octave or two, may cringe a bit at the ultra-mannered emoting on \"Betrayed\". But by 1983, Reed had mastered the conversational style that starts with \"I'm Waiting for the Man\". The mumble-murmur of \"Turn Out the Light\" is so clearly Reed, providing such a specific kind of pleasure, that it might as well come with a trademark symbol attached to each line.",

This is the soundtrack to a Julian Schnabel film about those performances.\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2008-11-12\n---\nLou Reed's Berlin was released in 1973, just after Transformer and just before Sally Can't Dance, two records that to this day remain Reed's most commercially successful. Berlin's legend of failure was born almost immediately (Rolling Stone: \"There are certain records that are so patently offensive that one wishes to take some kind of physical vengeance on the artists that perpetrate them\"; Robert Christgau: \"Will Lou lick the bloomin' boots of 'im that's got it?\"). Even Metal Machine Music, released two years later, wouldn't be enough to cleanse the general antagonistic shock of what people at the time took to be Reed's worst album, ever.\nStill, in retrospect, it's a funny album to pick on. A loose song cycle (it turned out that many of the Berlin tracks actually dated back to Reed's days in the Velvet Underground, and \"Berlin\" was a song on Reed's first album) about an unhappy couple, Jim and Caroline, living in the titular city, the record's absurdly depressing but hardly offensive. The characters do drugs, domestic violence, custody battles; eventually, Caroline kills herself. Berlin ends with Jim idly staring at a photograph of the dead mother of his children. Bob Ezrin, who would soon produce Pink Floyd's The Wall and who, at 23, had already produced Alice Cooper, brought a characteristically lush orchestration to the proceedings, but then again, Berlin was clearly a melodrama. Ezrin and Reed had their eyes on a stage adaptation before the record even came out; Berlin's reviews (and sales numbers) ended that project. To listen to Berlin now is to be basically mystified as to what everyone was so upset about, besides maybe its lack of a \"Walk on the Wild Side Pt. II\".\nReed shrugged it off, and went on to do things worthy of his audience's newfound hatred. Berlin, meanwhile, crept back into style. By the 1980s, Julian Schnabel was getting divorced to it, and by December 2006, the collective entreaties of various arts luminaries around New York finally led Reed to revive his second-most reviled creation for a four-night run at Brooklyn's St. Ann's Warehouse. Ezrin was back, to conduct; Sharon Jones, Antony Hegarty, and the entire Brooklyn Youth Chorus were on hand to provide backing vocals. Schnabel designed the set, and his daughter made a film to be projected against the back of it. The event was stoked by adulatory, apocalyptic press coverage (\"Sometimes called the most depressing album ever made‚Ä¶\" began one The New York Times paragraph) and an improbably beautiful week of melancholy, late fall weather. I attended on the year's last non-holiday Sunday.",

Because you're not just traveling through the boroughs but back through the decades as well, to a place where it's 1953 all the time-- a fairground fantasia that looks as if it's about to be swallowed by the imposing, endless expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. Coney Island feels like the last stop before the edge of the world. It's our collective vision of impending death, writ large in Ferris-wheel lights and cotton candy: One last flash of childhood nostalgia before we disappear into the void.\nThirty years ago, this is where Lou Reed went to bottom out and cash in his chips. Even if he wasn't dead, his career pretty much was: While hindsight has granted 1975's electronic-noise experiment Metal Machine Music a contrarian classic-- celebrated more as a symbolic \"fuck you\" than as a musical composition-- the reality was it forced him into a precarious financial position where he was being sued by his ex-manager and living day-to-day in the Gramercy Park Hotel, with the bill footed by a sympathetic RCA boss who forced Reed to, in his own words, \"go in and make a rock record.\" But when he did, creating what was to become Coney Island Baby, instead of referring to his usual inspirations-- transvestites, junkies, the underclass-- Reed exposed a far more shadowy, fascinating entity: his heart.\nBy 1976, we had already heard Reed do pretty much everything that could be done in a pop song: shoot heroin, suck on a ding-dong, kiss shiny boots of leather. And yet nothing he had done was quite as shocking as the revelation on Coney Island Baby's devastating title track that he always \"wanted to play football for the coach.\" But as the song drifts along its elegiac six-minute arc, the idea moves from the ridiculous (Lou as linebacker?) to the sublime (nothing fuels a young man's burgeoning homosexual impulses like getting pat on the butt by brawny alpha males in tights) to the unspeakably poignant: rock's reigning iconoclast admitting that he just wanted to fit in all along.\nConey Island Baby is the sound of Reed playing ball, assembling a stellar cast of backing players (bassist Bruce Yaw, guitarist Bob Kulick, and drummer Michael Suchorsky) to elevate his gutter-bound songwriting up to 70s FM rock-radio standards. You can see why some critics deemed the album a commercial concession: \"Charley's Girl\" is essentially a mash-up of Reed's two biggest hits, setting \"Sweet Jane\" strums to the doo-doo-doo cadence of \"Walk on the Wild Side\"; \"She's My Best Friend\" was an old Velvet Underground rave-up reborn as an elegant, theatrical six-minute set piece. But even if the guitar solos verge on Eric Clapton/Mark Knopfler levels of tastefulness, it's hard to imagine another singer-songwriter from the era producing a song as chilling as \"Kicks\", a survey of vices that proffers murder as the ultimate high, with Reed effectively laying down the challenge to those who want to live vicariously through his seedy explorations.",
