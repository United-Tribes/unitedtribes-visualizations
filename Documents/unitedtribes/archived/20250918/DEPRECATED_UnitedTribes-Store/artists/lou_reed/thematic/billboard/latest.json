The innovative singer-songwriter’s vast archive — including previously unheard songs, rare videos and unpublished poetry — is currently on view at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.\nLou Reed: Caught Between the Twisted Stars, the first large-scale exhibition of Reed’s archive, which opened on Thursday (June 9), was curated by Don Fleming and Jason Stern, who served as the archivist for the Lou Reed Archive, and as Reed’s technical director and archivist during his lifetime, respectively. It contains audio, film, photography, articles, books and poems from the late songwriter, musician, performer, poet and photographer, spanning his creative beginnings in high school, the Velvet Underground and his solo career.\nSpeaking to Billboard, Fleming recalled how the journey to this exhibition started about seven years ago, when he and Stern first started going through all the boxes in storage that Reed had kept for decades, both in a 10 x 15-foot storage unit and at the Sister Ray Enterprises office. While they worked through the materials in those spaces, the archive was acquired by the library in 2017, and Fleming and Stern were tasked with mounting the exhibition.\nTrending on Billboard\n“[The Library for the Performing Arts] saw us as a natural fit for putting the exhibition together, because we already knew so intimately what was in there. So we were really happy to do that because we wanted to, finally, after all these years, have the public see all these cool things that we’ve been seeing all along,” said Fleming.\nThe exhibition takes a semi-chronological approach, but divides aspects of Reed’s career thematically, with rooms dedicated to his work with the Velvet Underground—in the 1960s as well as when the band reunited briefly in the 1990s—followed by a poetry room representing the creatively rich time between the Velvet Underground’s disbanding and Reed’s solo career. The centerpiece of the exhibition, which Fleming and Stern named the “passion realism room” after the liner notes of Reed’s 1975 album Metal Machine Music, encompasses the 40-some years of Reed’s post-Velvets career.\nCaught Between the Twisted Stars also has a screening room. “We not only had hundreds of hours of audio that no one’s ever heard, but Lou had collected, amassed a lot of videos, mostly references of him on television shows or different things. So we’ve made a whole day’s worth of screenings of material from that collection,” said Fleming.\nOne notable find from the archives is a demo tape from May 1965 that Reed mailed to himself but never opened up. Fleming and Stern recall searching for the tape and stumbling upon it by surprise. “We’d heard of [the demo], we knew it existed,” said Stern. “We were literally packing up the boxes of Sister Ray Enterprises after cataloging just about everything, and one of the last parts of the office that we were boxing up is what contained this tape.” The tape contains a recording of Lou Reed and fellow Velvet Underground founding member John Cale performing Reed’s compositions as folk songs. “It just sounds like Bob Dylan. He’s got a harmonica with the neck brace, and it’s got the whole Dylan sound,” said Fleming. “We knew that this period existed for Lou, and we knew that John and Lou had actually been on street corners busking songs in this manner, but no one had ever heard what it actually sounded like, and so for the first time, we were able to hear that.” The demos will be released as a standalone record titled Words & Music, May 1965 on Light in the Attic Records in partnership with his widow, musician/performance artist Laurie Anderson.\nFleming and Stern explained that they wanted Reed’s voice to be felt throughout the exhibition. “You’re going to see Lou’s text all over every wall, because every section, it was about the deliberate nature of how he knew he what he was doing when it comes to every facet of his career. Lou was very open about his decision making and his process and his intentions,” said Stern. “We just let the guy speak for himself wherever we could”\nThe curators hope that this exhibition provides perspective on the breadth of Reed’s work. “We just wanted to shine a light on the fact that this guy never stopped evolving, that he kept moving forward one way or the other, all of this time, decade after decade,” said Stern. “It was important to make sure that people [could] see that Lou contained a lot of layers.”\nLou Reed: Caught Between the Twisted Stars is open at The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center until March 2023, although, as is most often the case with libraries, Reed’s archive will continue to be available to curious minds once the exhibition wraps. You can plan your visit here.",

The collection will drop on Aug. 26 in celebration of what would have been Reed’s 80th birthday; the singer/guitarist died in 2013 at age 71 of liver disease.\nAccording to a release announcing Words & Music, it offers an “extraordinary, unvarnished and plainly poignant insight into one of America’s true poet-songwriters.” The album explores songs written by a then-unknown Reed and recorded by his VU bandmate and musical partner John Cale, which, the release notes, Reed mailed to himself as a “poor man’s copyright” and which remained sealed in their original envelope and unopened for nearly half a century.\nTrending on Billboard\nAlso included on 1965 are several previously unreleased compositions that the release promised give a glimpse of Reed’s creative process and early influences. Avant garde artist/performer and Reed widow Anderson produced the collection along with Don Fleming, Jason Stern, the late Hal Willner and Matt Sullivan, with liner notes from acclaimed journalist/author Griel Marcus.\nThe liner notes from Fleming and Stern reveal that the pair found a number of exciting tapes at Reed’s Sister Ray Enterprises office, including some of the rocker’s earliest work. Among the rarities are a 1958 rehearsal with his high school doo-wop group The Jades (aka The Shades), as well as a listen to Reed’s dip into folk music in 1963-64 while he was attending Syracuse University, including acoustic guitar/harmonica takes on Bob Dylan’s “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right,” as well as instrumental versions of “Baby, Let Me Follow You Down” and “Michael, Row the Beat Ashore” and his own “W, & X, Y, Z Blues.”\n“Heroin” and “I’m Waiting for the Man” ended up on the Velvet Underground’s landmark 1967 debut, The Velvet Underground & Nico, where they were presented in the band’s signature dark, driving rock style. On 1965 the songs finds Reed on acoustic guitar and harmonica, with Cale singing harmonies in a style described as being akin to folk trio Peter, Paul & Mary. In addition, “Heroin” features alternate lyrics, including 3 lines that were later dropped in the studio, while “Pale Blue Eyes” — which surfaced on the VU’s third studio album, 1969’s The Velvet Underground — was completely re-written in its final version, with only one of the original verses remaining.\nTV on the Radio’s Tunde Adebimpe will host a podcast exploring Words & Music, on a special program featuring exclusive audio, archival materials and interviews with a number of the album’s participants; the pod created in partnership with Little Everywhere and Ruinous Media, will be available on all platforms on Aug. 26.\nA 6-song digital EP, Gee Whiz, 1958-1964, will drop on Oct. 7 and feature the folk covers and original blues recordings from 1963-64.

He was 72.\nRock’s passing was confirmed with a message posted on his social accounts.\n“It is with the heaviest of hearts that we share our beloved psychedelic renegade Mick Rock has made the Jungian journey to the other side,” the tribute reads. “Those who had the pleasure of existing in his orbit, know that Mick was always so much more than ’The Man Who Shot The 70s.’”\nThe Brit is remembered as “a photographic poet — a true force of nature who spent his days doing exactly what he loved, always in his own delightfully outrageous way.” The cause of death has not been disclosed.\nPhoto: Nathalie Rock pic.twitter.com/I50ofDuO0r\n— Mick Rock (@TheRealMickRock) November 19, 2021\nBorn 1948 in London, Rock discovered his flair for camerawork while studying at Cambridge. A natural networker, he hooked up with locals Syd Barrett (of Pink Floyd) and Mick Jagger’s younger brother Chris.\nWith his relaxed demeanor, gift of the gab and keen eye for detail, Rock would get the type of access to the superstars that few, if any, are allowed.\nRock shot the likes of former Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Queen, the Sex Pistols, The Ramones, Blondie, and created some of the most famous images of The Thin White Duke.\nSome of Rock’s finest work was the result of his close relationship with Bowie. No other photographer would inhabit Bowie’s inner sanctum like Rock.\n“David knows I’ve always treated him and the work with the respect,” Rock told Billboard at the launch party for The Rise Of David Bowie, published by Taschen Books. “I do the same with Lou Reed. I don’t show every picture that I have, I think discretion is also important.”\nRock would go on to publish several collections of Bowie photos, including 2002’s Moonage Daydream and The Rise Of David Bowie 1972-1973, which hit the racks in September 2015, just months before Bowie’s death.\nHis artwork would make it to the next level, featuring as album covers, including such classics as Syd Barrett’s Madcap Laughs, Lou Reed’s Transformer and Coney Island Baby, Iggy and The Stooges’ Raw Power, Queen’s Queen II and Sheer Heart Attack, The Ramones’ End of the Century and Joan Jett’s I Love Rock ‘n’ Roll.\nRock was also the chief photographer on such films as The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Shortbus.\n“The Man Who Shot the Seventies” wasn’t stuck in time. He’d go on to shoot the likes of Snoop Dogg, Daft Punk, Lenny Kravitz , Janelle Monae, Motley Crue, and many more.\nDuring his lifetime, Rock had major exhibitions in Tokyo, Toronto, London, Liverpool, Berlin, Manchester, New York, Oslo, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Sao Paolo, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Toulouse and elsewhere.\nRock’s “focus always total,” reads the tribute on the late photog’s socials. “A man fascinated with image, he absorbed visual beings through his lens and immersed himself in their art, thus creating some of the most magnificent photographs rock music has ever seen. To know Mick was to love him. He was a mythical creature; the likes of which we shall never experience again.”",

Fonfara is best known for his decade-long run performing with late punk progenitor Reed on the albums Rock and Roll Heart (1976), Street Hassle (1978), Live: Take No Prisoners (1978), The Bells (1979) and 1980’s Growing Up in Public, which he co-wrote and co-produced with Reed.\n“It is with heavy hearts that we sadly announce the passing of our dear friend and long-time bandmate, Michael Fonfara,” read a statement from his longtime bandmates in The Downchild Blues Band. “He was an incredible musician, a gentle soul and we were honoured to share the stage with him every time we performed. He will be deeply missed. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family. There will be a celebration of life once we are all safely able to get together.”\nIn a lengthy, eclectic career that spanned more than 50 years, Fonfara performed with the 1960s rock bands The Electric Flag and Rhinoceros, Blackstone and Rough Trade, as well as adding “keyboard textures” on Foreigner’s multi-platinum 1981 4 album on the No. 4 hit “Urgent” and the track “Girl on the Moon.” Fonfara also recorded with the Everly Brothers, Grievous Angels, Cameo Blues Band and many others in a lauded career that included a 2000 Maple Blues Award honor for piano/keyboard player of the year.\nTrending on Billboard\nFonfara’s final recording was Downchild’s Live at the Toronto Jazz Festival 50th anniversary performance in 2019, which featured guest appearances from Dan Akroyd, Paul Shaffer, Kenny Neal, Gene Taylor, Erja Lyytinen and David Wilcox; Downchild was the inspiration for Akroyd and late comedy partner John Belushi’s The Blues Brothers.\n“He’s the best musician I’ve ever worked with,” said Downchild leader and co-founder Donnie Walsh in a statement, with bassist Gary Kendall adding, “Yesterday we lost a brother, a band mate, a co-writer and a dear friend. If you met him, you loved him. A creative genius.”\nCheck out a performance by the Downchild Blues Band and Fonfara rocking the Hammond B3 organ below.",

      "content": "---\ntitle: Lou Reed, B-52s, The Cure & More: 10 Acts That Earned Their First Billboard No. 1s on the Alternative Songs Chart\nauthor: Kevin Rutherford\nurl: https://www.billboard.com/pro/alternative-songs-first-number-ones-cure-kate-bush/\nhostname: billboard.com\ndescription: These acts didn't just get an Alternative Songs No. 1 -- their leaders were the first of their careers.\nsitename: Billboard\ndate: 2018-10-12\ncategories: ['Business']\ntags: ['bbcharts']\n---\nLou Reed, B-52s, The Cure & More: 10 Acts That Earned Their First Billboard No. 1s on the Alternative Songs Chart\nThese acts didn't just get an Alternative Songs No. 1 -- their leaders were the first of their careers.\nSince its inception 30 years ago, Billboard‘s Alternative Songs airplay chart has reflected the format’s unique platform as a springboard for acts that have gone from relative obscurity to global superstardom.\nImagine Dragons‘ first No. 1 song? “Radioactive,” on the Alternative Songs chart. Lorde‘s? “Royals,” Alternative Songs. Red Hot Chili Peppers, Alanis Morissette, twenty one pilots? Each of these acts first snagged a chart-topping song at the alternative radio format before becoming renowned worldwide.\nBut, in the early days of Alternative Songs, the tally wasn’t just a tastemaker for the potential next big thing in music, with acts like R.E.M., Jane’s Addiction and Green Day reaching new audiences. When the chart was first published in the Sept. 10, 1988, Billboard issue, certain established acts, some of which had already achieved vaunted, perhaps even fabled, status through some of their earlier work, had yet to earn No. 1 hit in America.\nBear in mind, after all, that although the chart began in the late ’80s, alternative music had been growing the world over, from the jangly, synth-driven sounds of The Smiths and their British peers to New York City punk rock. The genre didn’t just appear out of nowhere; musicians, many of whom had influenced those making the music on the first Alternative Songs chart, had been creating what came to be known as alternative music for years, and as such, there were veterans of the scene.\nAnd when Alternative Songs began, well, some finally got their due. From Lou Reed and Mick Jones to The Cure and the Talking Heads, acts without No. 1 Billboard hits finally got them.\nHere are a select 10 of those artists.\nLou Reed, “Dirty Blvd.”\nPerhaps the most remarkable example is The Velvet Underground‘s frontman Lou Reed, who had not only released five LPs with his old band, but also 14 solo albums pre-Alternative Songs. Of course, The Velvet Underground’s lack of commercial success in its time has been well-reported, and Reed managed the classic top 20 Billboard Hot 100 hit single “Walk on the Wild Side” in 1973 and one top 10 album, 1974’s Sally Can’t Dance, on the Billboard 200, but he wasn’t exactly topping charts, either.\nIn February 1989, just months after Alternative Songs’ creation, that changed for Reed, as “Dirty Blvd.” ascended to No. 1 for four weeks, becoming Reed’s first leader on any Billboard chart. It was no fluke, either; in addition to a pair of top 20 hits on the tally in the ensuing year-and-a-half (including one, the No. 13-peaking “Nobody But You,” with former Velvet Underground bandmate John Cale), lightning struck again for Reed in the form of 1992’s “What’s Good,” which ruled the list for three weeks.\nKate Bush, “Love and Anger”\nKate Bush became the first solo woman to rule Alternative Songs, and she did so a decade after her first-charting title on a Billboard ranking. When “Love and Anger” reached No. 1 in December 1989, it followed 10 years of intermittent appearances by Bush on various charts. First there was “The Man With the Child in His Eyes,” which peaked at No. 85 on the Hot 100 in March 1979. Then came the enduring “Running Up That Hill,” which hit No. 30 in 1985, and “Don’t Give Up,” with Peter Gabriel (No. 76, 1987).\nUnlike some of her contemporaries on this list, Bush’s Alternative Songs No. 1 remains her only leader on any Billboard chart, song- or album-based, to date, although she added three more Alternative Songs top 10s (plus a No. 11-peaking cover of Elton John‘s “Rocket Man”) through 1993.\nMick Jones — Big Audio Dynamite, “Just Play Music!”\nWhen Jones formed Big Audio Dynamite in 1984 following his removal from his post as The Clash‘s lead singer and guitarist, he had no No. 1s to his name with his former band (which still boasts no chart-toppers to this day). But Jones and co. were among the first to take advantage of the newly formed Alternative Songs chart, as “Just Play Music!” became the list’s second No. 1 (after Siouxsie & The Banshees‘ “Peek-a-Boo”), in September 1988.\nThe band was fairly successful on the ranking in its first few years of existence; in addition to “Music!,” Big Audio Dynamite (eventually named Big Audio Dynamite II and then just Big Audio) scored an additional No. 1 with “Rush,” which samples The Who‘s Baba O’Riley,” in August 1991 — and after, three more top 10s.\nJohnny Marr — Electronic, “Get the Message”; Morrissey, “Tomorrow”\nIf there’s any band that best exemplifies alternative without actually having a single song on the Alternative Songs chart, it’s The Smiths, whose period of music-making (1982-87) completely predates the list’s existence. But that doesn’t mean that its members didn’t go on to achieve Alternative Songs success. First came guitarist Johnny Marr, whose Electronic project with New Order‘s Bernard Sumner snagged Marr’s first-ever Billboard No. 1 in the summer of 1991, the two-week leader “Get the Message.”\nFormer Smiths frontman Morrissey, who first reached Alternative Songs as a solo artist in 1989 with the No. 3-peaking “The Last of the Famous International Playboys,” followed a year later with “Tomorrow,” his first Billboard leader, a six-week No. 1 beginning in August 1992.\nJohn Lydon/Public Image Ltd., “Disappointed”\nJohn Lydon — or Johnny Rotten, if you’d like — formed Public Image Ltd. in 1978 after leaving the Sex Pistols earlier that year. His old band hadn’t scored much Billboard chart success, but then again, neither did PIL for a while, failing to crack the top 100 of the Billboard 200 with its early releases.\n“Disappointed,” however, became Lydon’s first, and to date only, Billboard No. 1 when it ascended to the top of Alternative Songs for one week (July 29, 1989). PIL was a regular presence in Alternative Songs’ early days, snagging five top 20s in all between May 1989 and March 1992.\nElvis Costello, “Veronica”\nHe’d been around the block quite a few times by the time Alternative Songs came into existence, but Elvis Costello nonetheless lacked a Billboard No. 1 before March 1989; he had notched a top 10 album on the Billboard 200, Armed Forces, as well as a handful of appearances on the Hot 100 and the Mainstream Rock Songs airplay chart.\nCostello, of course, was probably always going to benefit from Alternative Songs’ creation; ever since 1977’s My Aim Is True and his rebellious 1977 Saturday Night Live performance of “Radio Radio,” Costello had been associated with the very spirit of the genre. And when “Veronica” ruled the airwaves in 1989, it paved the way for three more top 10s on the list, including a second No. 1, “The Other Side of Summer,” in 1991.\nNotably, an act not necessarily associated with alternative co-wrote “Veronica” with Costello: Paul McCartney. The pair also penned McCartney’s “My Brave Face,” with both songs reaching the Hot 100’s top 40 in 1989.\nThe Cure, “Fascination Street”\nThe Cure began appearing on Billboard‘s Dance Club Songs chart in 1980, and the Robert Smith-fronted U.K. act was fairly prolific on both that list and the Billboard 200 in the 1980s, leading up to the band’s first Hot 100 appearance, “In Between Days,” in 1986, and its first top 40 hit, “Just Like Heaven,” in early 1988.\nThe Cure didn’t claim a No. 1 prize stateside, however, until “Fascination Street,” a seven-week ruler of Alternative Songs from 1989’s Disintegration. And more was to follow; in all, The Cure nabbed four leaders on the list through 1992.\nThe B-52s, “Channel Z”\nEver heard of being big in Canada? The B-52s sure were … well, somewhat. “Rock Lobster,” first released in 1978 from the new-wave Georgians’ debut album, performed modestly in the United States, peaking at No. 56 on the Hot 100 in 1980, but it led RPM’s Canada Top Singles chart that year, in addition to becoming a top three hit in Australia.\nDespite those early inroads, the band never managed a chart-topper in America until “Channel Z,” which led Alternative Songs for three weeks beginning on the Aug. 5, 1989, tally. To date, the band earned each of its No. 1s on a Billboard chart on Alternative Songs, with “Love Shack” (a No. 3 Hot 100 smash) and “Good Stuff” also reigning.\nPeter Murphy, “Cuts You Up”; Love and Rockets, “So Alive”\nFollowing the extinction of Bauhaus in 1983, the post-punk quartet broke into two pieces: frontman Peter Murphy struck out on his own, while Daniel Ash, David J and Kevin Haskins formed Love and Rockets.\nEach former Bauhaus member eventually enjoyed a trip to No. 1 on a Billboard chart, and each on Alternative Songs. Love and Rockets’ “So Alive” led in summer 1989, and Murphy’s “Cuts You Up” followed in winter/spring 1990.\nTalking Heads, “Sax and Violins”\nYep, that’s right: for all the success that the Talking Heads had experienced throughout the late 1970s and the duration of the ’80s (they even released their own concert film, Stop Making Sense), the band never notched a No. 1 song until its final single, “Sax and Violins.” Not “Burning Down the House,” a No. 9 Hot 100 hit. Nor “And She Was,” which reached No. 11 on Mainstream Rock Songs. At last, “Sax” topped Alternative Songs in February 1992. Call it a pinch-hit homer in the bottom of the ninth.",

Finding Lou’s own cassette tape in the archive, that he recorded at the event, was very exciting because we know about the reading but hat little idea of what he had read. His introductions to the pieces also gave us great insight into his creative process.”\nDo Angels Need Haircuts? is due out this April and will feature photography by Reed himself, as well as other ephemera from the era.

But it’s still pretty funny to learn what he told MGMT. MGMT, whose new album Little Dark Age just came out, recently appeared on Tom Scharpling’s The Best Show. And as Pitchfork points out, during a conversation about the band’s messy 2010 sophomore album Congratulations, MGMT frontman Andrew VanWyngarden told the story about how they tried to recruit Lou Reed to contribute to the album, and how Reed turned them down. Here’s what VanWyngarden said:\nWe had a breakfast meeting with Lou Reed because we wanted him to do spoken-word over “Lady Dada’s Nightmare.” And he pretty much said it didn’t need it. And then he also talked about how we didn’t need managers. And our managers were there…\nTrending on Billboard\nBut at least we got to meet him. And then we saw him at the [Westminster] Dog Show… We kind of, like, dressed up like dandies. We were just being really silly. Fred had on a top hat, and I had on a velvet jacket and a scarf and gloves. I had a notepad. I was taking notes on the dogs.\nYou can hear the episode of The Best Show here; the stuff about Reed starts around the 53:40 mark.\nThis article originally appeared on Stereogum.",

He worked with acts including Carole King, Lou Reed, Bon Jovi and Pearl Jam.\nsitename: Billboard\ndate: 2024-10-23\ncategories: ['Publishing']\ntags: ['ASCAP, John Titta, obituary']\n---\nJohn Titta, Longtime ASCAP Executive and Songwriter Advocate, Dies\nTitta worked with artists including Carole King, Lou Reed, Bon Jovi and Pearl Jam over a career spanning decades.\nLongtime songwriter advocate John Titta, who served as executive vp/chief creative officer at ASCAP, died Monday (Oct. 21) after a two-year battle with cancer. His age is unknown.\n“All of us at ASCAP are heartbroken,” said ASCAP president/chairman and songwriter Paul Williams in a statement. “John Titta was one of a kind, and truly one of the most beloved music industry executives I have known, with deep ties to songwriters across genres and generations. John — you had a song in your heart always, and you will always be in our hearts. I miss you already.”\nASCAP CEO Elizabeth Matthews added, “John Titta’s warmth, his humor, his kindness, his love of family, and his passion for music were infectious. He was a north star for me personally, and for all of us at ASCAP. John was instrumental in the success of so many songwriters throughout his storied career, and he shared his love of music and songwriters so freely that we all felt the joy. All of us in the ASCAP family are devastated by his passing. Titta — we love you.”\nTrending on Billboard\nThe lifelong Staten Island resident started as a musician, songwriter and music teacher before joining Screen Gems/EMI music as a manager, signing such acts as The Smithereens and working with the legendary Carole King and Lou Reed. He then moved to PolyGram Music Publishing, where, as vp of A&R, he signed Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, Pearl Jam, Brian McKnight, k.d. lang, Billy Ray Cyrus and songwriter Jimmy Webb, among others. Before joining ASCAP in 2013, where he led the membership team, he also had stints at Warner Chappell Music as senior vp/GM, where he worked with Missy Elliott, Shaggy, Bruce Hornsby, Kid Rock and many others, as well as running his own independent music publishing company and label, MPCA Music Publishing and Recordings.\nHe kept his creative side alive by playing on albums by Ringo Starr, Michael McDonald, Sambora and others, as well as producing and A&R’ing albums by Dionne Warwick, Todd Rundgren, Donny & Marie Osmond and others.\nTributes to Titta came pouring in on social media from top songwriters. “There’s a giant hole in the hearts of all of us who loved John Titta today. Such a huge loss,” wrote Diane Warren on Facebook. “John loved songwriters. And we loved him. Rest in Power my dear friend. There’s some pretty great songwriters up there waiting to give you a big hug.”\nSam Hollander also expressed his appreciation, writing on Facebook, “John was one of the genuinely good guys in this layered industry—a real advocate for songwriters & artists back when music was more than just algorithms. If he believed in you, he fought for you, no matter your place in the proverbial pecking order. I was blessed to have him in my corner & share decades of incredible hangs—he was just a sweet, funny, generous soul who made you feel heard.”\nTitta was also a Songwriters Hall of Fame board member. “The quintessential New York Italian, John loved his family, friends — especially those who became family, music, songwriters, artists, creative talent, The Godfather films, Staten Island and life itself. He was extremely proud of being a SHOF Board member, thought of it as ‘the feather in his cap’ and was one of our most active and dedicated board members,” says Linda Moran, president/CEO of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, via email. “Even when going through personal hardships and heartaches, he always had a smile on his face and a kind word to say, so that you would never know what he was experiencing.”\nFellow board member and Universal Music Publishing Group North America president Evan Lamberg tells Billboard, “John’s love of people, artists and songwriters is unmatched. The way he cared for his friends, of which he had many, was all heart. He made a big positive difference in so many lives and we will all miss him dearly.”\nTitta seemed impossibly connected to a wide swath of the entertainment community. When a luminary would die, most recently songwriters JD Souther and Kris Kristofferson and comedian Bob Newhart, he would endearingly post a photo of himself with the deceased and share a warm, personal memory on social media.\nSurvivors include his wife Lana, sons Alex and Julian, daughter Martine, grandson Mason, and his brother Michael. The family is planning a private service to be followed by a memorial at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the John and Rose Titta Fund, set up by Titta in memory of his parents to help children on the autism spectrum through music programs. Donations can be made through the ASCAP Foundation.",
