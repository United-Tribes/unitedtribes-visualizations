It’s a picture that both vividly reflects the album’s thematic autopsy of the dark heart burning inside the American dream, and the ’80s NYC underground itself, a visualization of the feral noise erupting at night in the shadow of the skyscrapers. And coming from a band that’s hardly lacking for T-shirt-worthy album covers, Bad Moon Rising has remained the perfect avatar for Sonic Youth’s violent collision of primitivism and futurism, and their tendency to invest live performance with all the horror and transcendence of a ritual sacrifice.\nA quarter century later, Sonic Youth would recreate that incendiary scene on the shores of the East River—though instead of lighting up a wicker man, they offered up themselves. The band’s August 2011 appearance at the Williamsburg waterfront wasn’t technically their last concert, but it was the final appearance of the Sonic Youth that we had come to know and love: the familial, telepathic, eternally spry entity who could translate avant-garde guitarchitecture into punk-rock abandon and vice versa, led by the world’s coolest mom and dad. Behind the scenes, however, Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon were on the verge of ending their 27-year marriage, and once the breakup was made public two months later, Sonic Youth’s seemingly eternal flame was suddenly extinguished with a bucket of cold water. The band would fulfill a handful of South American dates already on the books for that November, a lame-duck campaign Gordon would later describe in her memoir as a “raw, weird pornography of strain and distance.” But if someone were to make a factually sloppy Bohemian Rhapsody-style biopic about Sonic Youth, then the Williamsburg show would be its glorious Live Aid-sized climax—the revisionist Hollywood ending for a doomed New York institution.\nLive in Brooklyn 2011 was originally made available in 2020 as part of the deluge of official bootlegs that’s flooded Sonic Youth’s Bandcamp page, but it’s the first live recording from that batch to be mixed, mastered, and packaged for physical release (via Silver Current, the boutique outsider-psych label run by Comets on Fire/Howlin’ Rain honcho Ethan Miller). The special treatment is a testament to the show’s significance in Sonic Youth lore and to the peerless performance captured on the recording. Those who experienced this show first-hand, blissfully unaware of the drama stewing offstage, were treated to the rare spectacle of a band hitting explosive new peaks as a live act some 30 years into the game. But with the benefit of hindsight, Live in Brooklyn 2011 sounds more like the adrenalized fight-or-flight response from a band that knew its days were numbered. As Gordon would later write of the band’s final shows: “What got me through was being onstage, the visceral thrill of performing. Extreme noise and dissonance can be an incredibly cleansing thing.”",

Documents of their last few years together show a band that had perfected its live show and was spending a lot of time revisiting the songs of its early days. Battery Park, commercially released for the first time this month, was originally given away along with pre-orders of the band’s final full-length, The Eternal, 10 years ago. A free show in a lower Manhattan park on the Fourth of July is a pretty good place to capture a band that was forever inseparable from New York City, specifically its lower reaches.\nTrue professionals—the only events that ever derailed them were a massive instrument theft in 1999 and, finally, the breakup of a marriage—and seasoned festival players after years on the European circuit, they handled a daylight set in a park like just another day at the office. That might make it sound as if they were going through the motions, but that undersells how seriously they took their job. Up until the end, they came to play.\nThe set is relatively heavy on audience-friendly tracks from Daydream Nation. That album had just turned 20, and Sonic Youth had spent a good amount of time in the previous months on tour playing it in its entirety. Those songs perfectly showcased how polished their organized whirlwind had become over the years, while retaining the ability to give listeners whiplash with a sudden change of pace or blast of noise. “Hey Joni” veers from hardcore ranting to dissonant squalls to furious rave-up. “The Sprawl” is the set’s jammiest improv moment, extending into a dreamy cymbal-and-guitar back and forth, dying down to just a single strummed note, then roaring back. It’s also a tease for those fans who lived for the moments when the band would stretch out, toying with effects to create not so much a wall of sound as a whole, enclosed room.\nA couple years later, even Daydream Nation would seem like recent material in a Sonic Youth set, as their last few shows consisted almost exclusively of material from the Bad Moon Rising through Sister era. This set didn’t touch any of those, instead reaching back to the band’s debut self-titled EP and first LP, Confusion Is Sex. Hearing those 1982 songs played by 2008 Sonic Youth collapses time in a way that’s more familiar to reunion tours, but of course there was no break for this band until they called it quits. Early, bare-bones no-wave stompers “World Looks Red” and “Making the Nature Scene” get the benefit of more musicality and, of course, Steve Shelley’s drumming, the X factor that propelled the band from very good to one of the greatest of all time.",

In 1992, they released Dirty, which contained “100%”—a breathtakingly catchy sorta-hit that managed to distill everything great and weird about the band in two-and-a-half minutes, even if it didn’t quite reach the heights of the contemporaries they nurtured. It was their “Cannonball,” in other words, or it could have been, if MTV played it more. By 1995, they’d release an album best remembered for containing a song nearly as long as a sitcom without commercial breaks.\nIn between was Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star, which resisted the relative concision of 1990’s Goo and 1992’s Dirty but still bore the whiff of commercial expectations. Released a month after Kurt Cobain’s suicide and in the middle of a messy alternative-rock culture explosion that Sonic Youth helped usher in but never particularly wanted for themselves, the album was shaggy by design—a concerted effort to loosen up after the rigor of previous studio efforts. You can’t judge an album by its cover and yet: Daydream Nation, Goo and Dirty boasted artwork by Gerhard Richter, Raymond Pettibon, and Mike Kelley, respectively—textbook examples of the band’s essential role as conduit between the underground and the mainstream. Experimental’s packaging, meanwhile, was hastily assembled by an in-house designer at Geffen. Everything about the album reeked of ambivalence.\n“We wanted it to be less rock,” Kim Gordon said in David Browne’s Sonic Youth biography Goodbye 20th Century. “Dirty was pretty much the pinnacle of that. I guess we were really disappointed in the label that they didn’t get MTV to play the record. Or we just felt, ‘Well, we’re just not that sort of band anyway.’” Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star is about the limbo between begrudging aspiration for pop success and the relief in discovering it was never meant to be. This isn’t just subtext: “Screaming Skull” shouts out the Lemonheads, Hüsker Dü, and Superchunk, dazed that their albums could be purchased at an SST Superstore on the Sunset Strip.\nIt is hard to hear, in hindsight, how the album is “less rock”—there are all manner of guitars doing things that seemingly only Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo knew how to make them do. “Starfield Road” is a burst of controlled mayhem that gets in and out in barely more than two minutes. Buzz Bin-worthy single “Bull in the Heather” and “Skink” are Kim Gordon at her Kim Gordon-est, the former enlisting both Bikini Kill’s Kathleen Hanna and one of Steve Shelley’s most infectious beats.",

Like anything, the act was a symbol, irreverent, a simple fuck-you. In a way, it was noise: the sound of life and death at the same time, annihilating music and rendering it limitless.\nThis clip from Weatherman ‘69—shot and directed by the band’s SST Records comrade and eventual art world fixture Raymond Pettibon—remains a shining document of Sonic Youth’s anarchic era on that L.A. hardcore label. EVOL, the band’s sordid third LP, released in 1986, was their first of two pivotal albums for SST. Sonic Youth began to fuse with lawless West Coast punk: Minutemen and Black Flag versus sadistic cops and sun-bleached strip-mall banality. This ultimately showed how unmistakably East Village the Sonic Youth camp was. Sonic Youth was subterranean subway clangor; windowless bohemia; a fast-walking stomp on a sidewalk grate; the hallowed doors of Trash & Vaudeville; a secret. As if to assert their Downtown identity, the album opens with the somnambulant churn of “Tom Violence,” a song inspired by Television’s Tom Verlaine, which narrates a classic renegade pose. In her liner notes to the 1993 CD edition, transgressive zine writer Lisa Suckdog quoted Moore’s lyrics: “‘I left home for experience’—me, too!’”\nBy 1988’s Daydream Nation, Sonic Youth’s deep inquiry into pop and the avant-garde—into Madonna on the one hand and La Monte Young on the other—had cohered into a fundamental sound. Pettibon’s black-and-white cover illustration for 1990’s Goo became an eternal RayBanned shorthand for wry art-punk cool. But on EVOL, the pieces were still laid bare: bent glitter-pop here, macabre spoken-word there, gauzy instrumental noise, a persistent clatter, all with a reverby DIY iridescence that sounds buried in the ground. EVOL is “underground” as both form and aesthetic: deconstructed and raw, dim and boomy. Gordon once called the sound of Downtown “abandoned,” and that fits here, too. If Daydream Nation is Sonic Youth’s opus, EVOL was crucial research. There’s a directness that makes everything feel close. It is pure tension with little release. The entire record is a shadow.\nEVOL was not just a skewering of rock’n’roll but also of America. A college syllabus could revolve around its vast allusions to Marilyn Monroe, Charles Manson, The Great Gatsby, and Alfred Hitchcock. EVOL might have a cheeky Richard Kern horror-film still on the cover, it might feel like the most dissonant passages of the Grateful Dead’s Dark Star held captive and tormented in a cavernous haunted house, but the album was beyond a “faux-goth” record, as Gordon once described it. EVOL is a graveyard for 1960s peace-and-love idealism. (The title is “love” backwards.) The destructive force of no wave and hardcore was cast as a new kind of sonic conceptual art.",

While they didn’t leave the freaky stuff behind entirely, they started serving it up with a spoonful of sugar.\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2019-05-09\n---\nSonic Youth’s superpower was always their ability to contain their experimental sprawl just enough. Formed as much as an art project as a musical one, they’ve always been a part of the fringe. But their place within experimentalism’s wild terrain was solidly centrist. Way weirder stuff sat to the left, like the no wave scene of musicians who pummeled their instruments more than they played them, and to the right, art nerds with milquetoast pock-rock groups who occasionally borrowed from the silvery shine Sonic Youth lacquered over most of their songs. Their fifth album, 1988’s Daydream Nation, was the bullseye in the center of the Venn diagram between in and out, a gleaming collection of anthems with guitar noise and beautiful riffs doled out in equal measure.\nPerfection is a difficult thing to bounce back from, especially when it coincides with the end of the ’80s, a decade whose Reagan-era doom was hospitable to making a racket in protest. In the years after Daydream Nation, they released a number of uneven albums, Goo, Dirty, and Experimental Jetset, Trash, and No Star. Within each, though, were a few perfect moments that pointed a way forward. Towards the end of 1992’s Dirty is “JC,” a song that, in hindsight, served as a blueprint for 1995’s Washing Machine. The fuzz is still present, but it’s paired with the engine of Steve Shelley’s steady hip-hop drumbeat. The song is sung by bass player Kim Gordon, who actually really speaks more than sings, each line like a challenge to the one before it. “You’re walking through my heart once more, don’t forget to close the door,” she sings as an elegy for a friend who was murdered. Despite its more traditional rock structure, the song is still decorated by the wide expanse of feedback by guitarist Thurston Moore. Arguably, it has quite an ugly final 30 seconds, perhaps unnecessary after a deeply moving three and a half minutes. That must have been an argument Sonic Youth heard enough, as come 1995’s Washing Machine, their squall had softened into sparkles.\nAt least sometimes. The album begins with “Becuz,” a nasty romp led by Gordon’s groovy bass playing and her whispered sneer. Like on “JC,” Shelley’s backbeat anchors the song as it begins to swell. After two minutes, the whole thing gathers into that typical Sonic Youth feedback tornado, this one fairly heavily resembling the sound of a dentist drill. But something different happens: The song’s basic structure reassembles and keeps going, like the melody wrestled control back from all the disharmony.",

In recent years, those eager for new encounters with the group’s sound have made do with various members’ side projects and surprise guest appearances. (Kim Gordon and Lee Ranaldo even shared a stage at Dinosaur Jr’s 30th birthday bash.) Archived live shows and vinyl reissues of classic albums have trickled out of the band’s surviving merchandise machine. Though given how well Sonic Youth documented its prime-era productivity—with experimental EPs and imaginative collaborations showing up nearly as often as song-based albums—it’s reasonable to assume that the vaults aren’t stacked with unjustly overlooked material.\nThe gloomy state of this lowered-expectations game means that Spinhead Sessions prompts some moderate thrills. Titled after the studio where the band rehearsed for a movie-soundtracking job, these purely instrumental pieces from 1986 offer another look at musicians who had just recorded EVOL (and who were about to write Sister). At this point, they were so locked-in that they could prove compelling during practice time.\nThe music Sonic Youth contributed to 1987’s Made in USA was not released until 1995—that is, near the peak of the group’s major label-clout period (as well as that of the CD boom). That official soundtrack has never been mistaken for anything other than a collection of miniatures, few of which are given a chance to develop past the three-minute mark. Spinhead Sessions outdoes Made in USA merely by letting Sonic Youth be Sonic Youth. Freed from the need to provide concise film-music cues, they push a few of the spare themes created for a side-hustle gig into substantial workouts.\nThese performances are no less subtle for their matter-of-fact titles. “Ambient Guitar and Dreamy Theme,” the 16-minute opener, stirs nervy, tremolo guitar effects and a simple melodic line into a cauldron of dread in its first half. Eventually the atmosphere calms, thanks to some lightly strummed chords. “Theme With Noise” mixes some seductive slide-guitar playing into its miasma, and “High Mesa” builds from dreamy to cathartic, led by Steve Shelley’s gradually more forceful drumming. Overall, this half hour anticipates the tossed-off mastery of EPs the band would later issue through their SYR imprint.\nThat opening trio of cuts is the best this particular drawer in the vault has to offer. From there, Sessions tenders four shorter, less ambitious tracks. In terms of running time, this sequence pads the release out beyond EP length—though the material isn’t any more compelling than most stretches on Made in USA. Yet despite its clear status as a barrel-scraping effort, this album isn’t just for the most desperate fans. While it’s unavoidably casual in nature, the bulk of this set provides the pleasure of Sonic Youth during an era of good spirits and high creativity.",

      "content": "---\ntitle: Horsegirl: Versions of Modern Performance\nauthor: Jayson Greene\nurl: https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/horsegirl-versions-of-modern-performance/\nhostname: pitchfork.com\ndescription: Read Jayson Greene’s review of the album.\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2022-06-06\n---\nCollectively, the members of Horsegirl are probably 20 years younger than their most recent influence. Gigi Reece and Nora Cheng are college freshmen, Penelope Lowenstein a high school senior, but Versions of Modern Performance glows with the drowsy heat of 30 years’ worth of indie rock. Depending on your age, you might hear Yo La Tengo or Stereolab in the featherlight vocals; maybe the fat, crayon-streaked guitars of Dinosaur Jr.’s J Mascis or Built to Spill’s Doug Martsch. The longer you listen, the more the album resembles a hedge maze made from familiar references—the yawn of the whammy bar on “Bog Bog 1” swirls in some My Bloody Valentine, while Cheng’s bird call of a melody on “Beautiful Song” evokes Laetitia Sadier. If a group of young people picked up some guitars to make a blurry, pleasing sound at any point in the past seven presidential administrations, you’ll hear echoes of them here.\nHorsegirl are breakout members of a largely teenaged Chicago indie scene, and their debut comes decked with auspicious cosigns from scene elders—John Agnello (Dinosaur Jr., Sonic Youth) is behind the boards, while Steve Shelley and Lee Ranaldo play on “Billy” and “Beautiful Song.” It’s a compliment, then, to say that Versions could have come out in 1997, or 1987, since that’s entirely the point. Indie rock of this era was loose-fitting, and in order to make it work, everyone has to play that way—hugging the downbeat too tight would curdle the vibe, as would an overly busy bassline. The sound has to stretch, like a dog in the sun, otherwise you’re not doing it right. Lowenstein and Cheng, who trade vocal duties alongside guitars and six-string electric bass, manipulate fuzz tones like batted balloons, while Reece hits the cymbals like someone throwing paint buckets at a barn. They’ve got the balance just right—no explosions, just a steady, nervous churn continuously disrupting the music’s placid surface.\nThis haze offers excellent cloud cover to hide songwriting surprises, and Horsegirl take the opportunity. You might have to listen to “The Fall of Horsegirl” twice to realize the hook is simply Lowenstein counting quietly to six. “Anti-glory” starts rumpled and messy before pulling taut for a chorus in which they simply snap “Dance!” at you, like they’re tossing firecrackers at your feet. “Billy” builds up a good head of steam before speeding up unexpectedly and veering into a corner.\nIf there are nice surprises throughout on Versions, there are no revelations. From the studied perfection of its guitar tones to the vocals that closely mimic their heroes, Versions is a bit like an apprentice’s masterwork, a demonstration that they’ve absorbed their lessons. The lyrics are fragmentary, open-ended, and occasionally arresting (“I’m on the run from the severed leg of my son,” from “Option 8”). But any capital-S Statements that Horsegirl might make are probably percolating somewhere in that soupy sound, waiting for the right moment—hopefully album two—when they will emerge. For now, Horsegirl aren’t so much carrying the torch as they are keeping the pilot light lit, low and steady.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
