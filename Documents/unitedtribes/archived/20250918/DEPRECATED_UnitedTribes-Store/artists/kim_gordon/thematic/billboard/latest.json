Get the details.\nsitename: Billboard\ndate: 2024-07-18\ncategories: ['Music News']\ntags: ['Music News, Pop']\n---\nKim Gordon just made one of the most divisive, incendiary statements one can make in 2024: she doesn’t like Taylor Swift.\nIn an interview with The Guardian published Wednesday (July 17), the musician revealed that — in spite of the “Karma” singer being at a popularity apex thanks to the Eras Tour’s prowess and The Tortured Poets Department‘s 12-week reign atop the Billboard 200 — she part of what appears to be an increasingly smaller group of people who don’t identify as Swifties.\n“I don’t know if it’s controversial but I’m not really a fan of Taylor Swift,” she told the publication when asked for her most polarizing pop culture opinion. “I couldn’t tell you what her music sounded like, actually.”\nGordon did, however, offer up another musician she can get behind. “When it comes to pop icons, I would choose Billie Eilish,” she said.\nTrending on Billboard\nThe interview comes just a day ahead of the former Sonic Youth band member’s July 18 and 19 performances at the Art Gallery of New South Wales’ Volume festival. Her remarks about Swift follow harsher criticism from stars like Dave Grohl and Courteney Love; at a recent Foo Fighters concert, the rocker implied that the pop star doesn’t perform live, while the Hole frontwoman told The Standard in April that Swift “is not important … she’s not interesting as an artist.”\nIn both cases, Swifties united to defend the “Fortnight” musician’s name online.\nAs for musical icons of the past, Gordon has a couple that she looked up to. “As a teenager, I listened to Billie Holiday and Joni Mitchell but I never actually thought it was possible to become a musician,” she told the publication. “There are certainly artists, but not necessarily female artists, who I was influenced by – artists like Lucio Fontana or Yves Klein, even Andy Warhol.”",

Along the way, she’ll perform at Big Ears, Treefort, and Primavera (Barcelona and Porto) Festivals.\n“I can’t believe the tour is finally happening,” Gordon says in a statement. “Looking forward to playing with my band who are amazing and bringing the music to you. You are the ones gonna make it sizzle.”\nGordon’s trans-Atlantic jaunt is in support of 2019’s No Home Record, her first solo album in 38 years of making music. The set peaked at No. 5 on Billboard’s Heatseekers Album chart, and Pitchfork described it as a “thrilling solo debut,” one that “lives at the vanguard of sound and performance, shot through with the beautiful, unsparing noise that has always defined her art.”\nSince the disbandment of Sonic Youth, which Gordon co-founded in 1981, the rocker has notched a number of firsts.\nIn 2015, she published her memoir Girl In a Band, which traced a childhood spent on both coasts, the highs and lows of the Sonic Youth years, and recounted her marriage of nearly three decades to bandmate Thurston Moore, and the ultimate dissolution of their marriage and the group.\nKim Gordon Sets Trans-Atlantic 2022 ‘No Home Tour’\nThe iconic Sonic Youth singer, guitarist and bass player will embark on her first-ever international headlining solo trek this March.",

Last week the Broad announced the lineup for the third edition of Summer Happenings at…\nSince opening in 2015, Los Angeles’ Broad Museum has become an important cultural landmark for the city and last week it announced the lineup for the third edition of its Summer Happenings event, combining the museum’s collection with performance art and pairings from 35 musical acts curated by prominent taste-makers.\nAmong those selecting talent are Afro-Punk documentary creator James Spooner; former Pitchfork director Brandon Stosuy, who now serves as editor-in-chief at The Creative Independent; and Ryu Takahashi, an independent curator, producer and artist manager based in New York and Tokyo. The Broad’s director of audience engagement Ed Patuto tells Billboard the four-part series, which runs June 30 through September, utilizes the entire downtown campus.\n“Outside on the plaza we built the East West Bank stage that holds upwards to 1,500 people and still has a really intimate feel,” Patuto explains. “We also utilize the lobby of the museum, our Oculus Hall on the second floor which is a flexible space that we transform into different things — in August we’re going to turn it into an underground Beijing punk club — and then we use the galleries on the third floor as well. Things happen all throughout the museum and we really like to give people an experience of going from performance or music into visual art in a somewhat seamless way.”\nThe first performance in the series “A Journey That Wasn’t — Part 1” explores artists representations of time and includes performances by experimental synth-rock band Gang Gang Dance, as well as DJ Stretch Armstrong, minimalist composer Terry Riley and tapper-turned-ordained minister Jean Grae, who will deliver a sermon on time, interspersed with her choir’s themed cover songs and special musical guests. Former Sonic Youth front-woman Kim Gordon leads “A Journey That Wasn’t — Part 2” on Sept. 29, joining drummer YoshimiO from Japanese rock band Boredoms for a collaborative and fully improvised instrumental set. They’ll be joined in the evening by curators of Banjee Ball, L.A.’s monthly celebration of voguing, dancing and catwalk strutting, as well as Swisha House label founder Michael “5000” Watts and Rio-based artist and no wave legend Arto Lindsay.\nRounding out the four-part series is a July 28 celebration of German artist and Fluxus movement founder Joseph Beuys, featuring Krautrock group faUSt and Baltimore duo Matmos, and a celebration of contemporary Chinese art set for Aug. 25 featuring pioneering Beijing post-punk band Re-TROS and Chinese-Canadian techno artist MIIIA. The event, titled “The Greater Body (Shi-Dati),” also features Daniel Collás and Juliet Swanbo from the Phenomenal Handclap Band and Jie Ma who will perform Collás’ original score for the pipa, a traditional four-stringed Chinese musical instrument, in accompaniment to director Zhou Hongbo’s documentary film Lotus Ferry about the eponymous district of Shanghai.\n“We have conversations with the artist about the theme of the evening, why we think that they would work with this evening, and for some artists that means creating something specifically that will only be performed that night,” Patuto tells Billboard. And while patrons may come for a specific concert, Patuto explains, they will typically wind up roaming through the museum’s various exhibits and performances, exploring the Broad’s 120,000-square-foot building that features two floors of gallery space and is the headquarters of The Broad Art Foundation’s worldwide lending library with loaned art from its vast collection to museums around the world since 1984.\n“We’ve developed a reputation for showcasing the unknown while celebrating L.A.’s vast cultural and artistic diversity,” explains Patuto, who says the goal of the series is to combine art and performance in new ways. He points to “The Greater Body” evening, which looks at the Chinese culture through a more contemporary lens.\n“We purposely said we want to bring artists from China who are doing good work right now and this is a very different kind of gathering of both performance art and various kinds of music that covers a much broader scope,” he says. “The focus is not on traditional forms but instead, is very contemporary and addresses what is happening now.\nTickets are $95 for all four performances or $30 for a single event.
