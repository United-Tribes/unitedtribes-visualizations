Listen to it here.\nsitename: Billboard\ndate: 2024-09-16\ncategories: ['Podcasts']\ntags: ['Music News, Podcasts, rock']\n---\nKISS spent the majority of its five-decade career disguising their faces in makeup. Now, as the band plans the next phase for its music and iconic characters, KISS is still leaving its fans with mystery and intrigue.\nAfter the culmination of The End of the Road Tour in December, KISS began the year with the sale of its name and likeness and plans to live eternally in the digital world. Details are scarce, but the band has said the virtual performance should launch in Las Vegas in 2027. In a conversation with Billboard’s Behind the Setlist podcast, frontman Paul Stanley won’t say exactly how the group will carry its legacy into the future. But in typical KISS fashion, Stanley has ambitious goals.\n“It’s a must-see, go-to experience,” Stanley boasts. “It’s beyond anything that anyone else has contemplated.”\nTrending on Billboard\nVirtual artists are nothing new: a Tupac Shakur hologram appeared at Coachella in 2012, and avatars have resurrected deceased musicians such as Ronnie James Duo and Whitney Houston for live performances. Those earlier examples of digital likenesses pale in comparison to Abba Voyage, a high-budget, mixed virtual reality-live music concert in London that has won rave reviews.\nIn April, KISS sold its name and likeness rights to Pophouse, the Swedish company that helped build Abba Voyage around virtual versions of Abba’s four members made to look decades younger. Although those early generations of avatars wowed audiences, KISS isn’t content to replicate the previous models, says Stanley.\n“We’re creating something that’s not a concert,” he explains. “The idea of a hologram — and it’s not a hologram, but that term seems to get thrown around a lot — but the idea a simulated concert is not what we want to do. Frankly, I would find that boring.”\nLike Abba Voyage, which takes place in the purpose-built, 3,000-capacity ABBA Arena in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, the KISS experience will require a dedicated venue built around the technology, says Stanley. Las Vegas is filled with venues, from Sphere to T-Mobile Arena to numerous theaters that host long-term residencies (Bruno Mars at Park MGM, for example). Stanley is mum on the venue but tells Billboard the final product will be more advanced than Abba Voyage.\n“Now, mind you, the Abba show is an older technology, because technology moves ahead at an exponential rate,” says Stanley. “So, by the time that show started to be presented, there was new technology.” To that end, he adds, KISS will work with Industrial Light & Magic, the visual effects company founded by filmmaker George Lucas that produced special effects for the Star Wars, Terminator and Jurassic Park franchises.\nKISS fans got a preview of its plans in December when then band revealed digital depictions showed at the final End of the Road concert and released a two-minute sizzle reel, KISS: A New Era Begins, that shows the band donning motion-capture technology to create their digital likenesses. Stanley insists that the final product will be far more advanced.\n“That was just an early — I don’t want to say rendering — but an early version of what is to come and is still being worked on,” says Stanley. “But it bears little resemblance to what was there. What we were showing was just the inception of the idea that we can continue on outside of flesh and blood.”\nAs for Stanley, he expects to stay busy outside of prepping the Las Vegas show. Stanley leads a retro-soul band, Paul Stanley’s Soul Station, that plays original and classic soul songs and released an album, Now and Then, in 2021. He has forged a successful career as a painter. Asked if he’ll release another solo album—following his 1978 eponymous album and Live to Win from 2006 — Stanley keeps his fans guessing.\n“We’ll see,” he says. “I’m not done with music, that’s for sure. I’ve become more judicious in what I do, picking and choosing, because as you get older, you see more and more that anything you do takes you away from something else. And at some point, it really comes down to picking and choosing what you do as it relates to what you don’t get to do. So yeah, I mean, I’ll certainly do more music. Music is a big part of who I am.”\nListen to the entire interview with Paul Stanley at the embedded Spotify player below, or go to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, iHeart or Everand.",

Multiple states have banned gender-affirming care for minors, claiming that “irreversible” healthcare affecting one’s gender shouldn’t be an option for those under the age of 18 — though some legislatures in Texas, Kansas and elsewhere have begun quietly attempting to raise that minimum age to 26.\nWhile these claims about “irreversible” procedures are common, the facts show that they are largely false. In an interview with Billboard last year, Dr. Joshua D. Safer, MD, explained that the kind of surgeries many of these right-wing lawmakers and Stanley are concerned about are already “typically reserved for adults,” with only extraordinary cases requiring more immediate intervention. “Prior to any gender-affirming medical or surgical intervention, all minors must have an intake with a knowledgeable mental health provider internal to our system. Once deemed ready for a medical/surgical intervention, the processes we have for adults are then brought into play,” he said.\nStanley’s statement is also directly refuted by every major medical organization in the U.S., including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, all of whom agree that gender-affirming care is not only not dangerous for trans youth, but in most cases, highly beneficial and life-saving.\nRead Stanley’s full statement below:",

He was loved by everyone in the know; the guitarists guitarist! My condolences to his family & friends. RIP.”\nSimmons’ KISS bandmate Paul Stanley also memorialized his friend, writing, “WOW. What awful news. Jeff Beck, one of the all time guitar masters has died. From the Yard Birds to The Jeff Beck Group on, he blazed a trail impossible to follow. Play on now and forever. @jeffbeckmusic.”\nOther reactions poured into Twitter from the likes of Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath and Dave Davies of The Kinks to Genesis’ Steve Hackett and Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page, the latter of whom described Beck as “the six-stringed Warrior” who had the ability to “channel music from the ethereal.”\nOver the course of his life, the British musician won eight Grammys out of 17 total nominations and was inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He also released 11 solo albums as well as studio sets with the Jeff Beck Group, the Yardbirds and the short-lived Beck, Bogert & Appice. His last and most recent LP was 18, a collaborative full-length with Johnny Depp in July.\nRead social media tributes to Beck’s memory below.",

The Kiss guitarist/singer revealed to fans over the weekend that he’s been stricken by the virus for the second time in six months. But this time he caught the highly contagious Omicron variant that has been causing a massive, global spike in new cases over the past few weeks.\n“My Omicron face! Yup. My entire family has it. I’m tired and have sniffles,” Stanley wrote on Sunday in a post featuring a close-up of the 69-year-old rock icon. “Most of my family have absolutely no symptoms. Do as you choose. I’m so glad I’m vaccinated.” Stanley first contracted COVID back in late August, which led to the cancellation of their planned gig at The Pavilion at Star Lake in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania.\nThe glam rockers were in the midst of a revamp of their End of the Road Tour, which has been billed as their final trek ever; the shows kicked off in January 2019 and then got postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic. The PA show came just a few gigs into the rebooted outing, which was then put on ice for two weeks after Stanley’s longtime bandmate, bassist/singer Gene Simmons, also contracted COVID.\nTrending on Billboard\nThe band got back out on the road in September and finished up their U.S. dates on Oct. 16 and played at October’s KISS Kruise before announcing that their Las Vegas residency — which was supposed to kick off on Wednesday (Dec. 29) — was being canceled as well two weeks after the band’s long-time guitar tech died from COVID-19. Kiss was slated to play 12 shows at the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood through Feb. 2022.\nCheck out Stanley’s post below.",

While a new date is yet to be announced, the band said the show has been postponed.\n“Tonight’s #KISS show at The Pavilion at Star Lake in Burgettstown, PA is unfortunately postponed due to Paul Stanley testing positive for COVID,” the band tweeted alongside a full statement. “More information about show dates will be made available ASAP.”\nThe statement also clarified that “everyone on the entire tour, both band and crew, are fully vaccinated.”\nTrending on Billboard\nAhead of the band’s announcement, Stanley took to Twitter to shoot down rumors about how severe his symptoms were. “PEOPLE!!! I am fine! I am not in ICU!” Stantey tweeted. “My heart allows me to do 26 miles a day on my bike! I don’t know where this came from but it’s absolute nonsense.” In a subsequent tweet, he wrote, “I had been sick with flu-like symptoms and was tested repeatedly and was negative. As of late this afternoon I tested positive. The crew, staff and band have all tested negative once again. More to follow.”\nThe glam rockers are currently on their End of the Road Tour, billed as their final trek ever, which kicked off in January 2019 and then had to reschedule dozens of 2020 dates due to the coronavirus pandemic. They resumed touring just last week in Massachusetts and have U.S. dates scheduled through October in Florida, followed by a December stint in Las Vegas and international dates booked through July 2022.\nSee Kiss’ and Stanley’s messages below:\nTonight's #KISS show at The Pavilion at Star Lake in Burgettstown, PA is unfortunately postponed due to Paul Stanley testing positive for COVID.

Watch our exclusive sneak peek.\nsitename: Billboard\ndate: 2021-06-25\ncategories: ['Rock']\n---\nKISS co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley go all the way back to the beginning in a preview clip of the upcoming A&E Biography: Kisstory special, which will air in two parts on June 27 and 28 (9-11 p.m. ET). In the exclusive preview shared with Billboard, the greasepaint rockers take a field trip to the famed Electric Lady Studios in New York’s Greenwich Village to reminisce about their first attempts to make music together.\n“From the beginning, Gene felt more like a relative … I felt real fortunate to have met him,” guitarist-singer Stanley, 69, says of his musical partner of half a century, bassist-singer Simmons, 71. “In spite of him driving me crazy a lot of times.”\nSimmons, a notorious keeper of the KISS flame, recalls the band being in an adjacent studio at the Jimi Hendrix-commissioned recording mecca when Stevie Wonder was recording his iconic 1972 hit “Superstition.”\n“Paul and I, the chemistry worked,” says Simmons in the definitive chronicle of the band directed by D.J. Viola (Terror in the Woods). “But it didn’t start that way.” The lone remaining original members of the group known for their bombastic, pyro-filled shows and signature painted faces sit down with their guitars at the studio for a strum down memory lane.\nSimmons says he’d never met another songwriter before he was introduced to Stanley by a friend, which leads to archival tape of a jammy rocker called “Sunday Driver,” eventually released as “Let Me Know” on the band’s self-titled 1974 debut album. The typically hard to impress Simmons recalls thinking, “Wow, that’s a good song!”\nThe special will also feature appearances from current KISS guitarist Tommy Thayer and drummer Eric Singer, as well as superfans Dave Grohl, and Tom Morello.\nWatch the preview below.",
