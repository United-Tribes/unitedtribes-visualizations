There at Mount Morris (now Marcus Garvey) Park, it was a different leap for mankind. The Harlem Cultural Festival, a concert series held over six Sundays, featured a seemingly infinite Rushmore of Black music icons: a then 19-year-old Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips, B.B. King, David Ruffin, and the Staple Singers, to name just a few. Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke. Mavis Staples and Mahalia Jackson practically ripped the clouds out of the sky with their gospel duet. It all started in the weeks before Woodstock.\nAnd yet, the remarkable festival footage lay dormant for 50 years before the Roots drummer Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson unfurled it for his directorial debut, Summer of Soul. The documentary—in theaters and on Hulu July 2, after winning top awards at Sundance—functions as both a concert film and a loving artifact of Black music amid the Civil Rights Movement. “Never mind the moon,” one festival-goer says in the doc. “Let’s get some of that cash in Harlem.”\nQuestlove first discovered the Harlem Cultural Festival in 1997 during a Roots tour stop in Tokyo, where he sat in the Soul Train Café dazzled by a two-minute bootleg clip of Sly and the Family Stone’s set, shown on a video screen. “I didn’t know they were playing to an all-Black crowd,” he recalled to Pitchfork. “I saw the word ‘festival’ and thought, Obviously it must be in Switzerland or Montreaux.” Two decades later, producers unearthed 40 hours of lost footage from the late videographer Hal Tulchin and tapped Questlove to condense it into archival gold. It was no easy feat, with the original cut clocking in at three and a half hours: “Cutting 90 minutes was one of the most painful things I’ve ever done,” he said. The result is a breathtaking capsule of Black music history that gives as much energy and gravity to the performances as it does to artists’ and attendees’ relived memories of the event.\nTalking over Zoom from his office at The Tonight Show in June, Questlove discussed the daunting task of chronicling and curating such a timeless display of grandeur.\nAhmir “Questlove” Thompson: When I was going through that funk of “ugh, I don’t know if I can do this,” my girlfriend snapped me out of it. Like: This is bigger than you. This is your chance to make history. It’s bigger than your nervousness of getting a bad review or embarrassing yourself in your directorial debut. This is your chance to right a wrong. It’s weird because the main motherlode of the interview weeks was March 13, 2020. And within days, the world was shut down. For half a second, I was like, I guess it was nice working with you guys, see ya. You’re watching death after death after death every night. Trucks of body bags on the corner. Who has the time to think about a movie when it’s like, is my mom going to be alive? After a two-week panic period, we got it together. We figured out inventive ways to conduct interviews. Mavis is a great example. We had this wheelie device that was like the Mars rovers, with a camera crew in the hallway of her apartment. They had to remote control this thing inside her apartment, and we did our audio interview that way. The timing of making this film changed this film.\nNo. It was gold. If anything, it was an embarrassment of riches. It was too much. I kept this on a 24-hour loop for about six months straight. Slept to it. Traveled to it. It was the only thing I consumed. I didn’t watch any movies, television shows. Nothing. If something hit me, I wanted to get it organically. While the master reel was being reprocessed and digitized—which took like five months—anything interesting I saw, I noted. When I felt that I had enough goosebump moments, I curated it like I curate my DJ sets or like I curate a show. I work backward. Always start with the ending first, and then work my way to the front.\nThe summit meeting between Mavis and Mahalia was one of the first things I saw. I knew it was so powerful; I didn’t want any interruptions. My first draft was three and a half hours, and that was my initial ending. But as we were cutting, we couldn’t help but see the mirroring of what was happening 50 years ago happening right now. My producer Joseph was like, “I don’t know if you want to go Kumbaya with this.” Once you force Mavis and Mahalia to the middle, it forces you to come up with an even stronger ending. By that point, I realized this is Nina’s moment to cap this off. With Nina at the end, suddenly, this film has an edge and energy to it.\nWhen I got to the Stevie Wonder drum solo, I knew that was the gob-smacking cold-open shocker of all shockers. People have never seen Stevie Wonder in a sort of percussion context. So I figured that’s my little wink to anyone coming in with folded arms like, OK, what’s the Roots drummer going to do with this film? Of course, he’s going to do a drum solo. There’s a point where Stevie and his bandleader Gene are riffing. When Stevie comes on stage, that’s when Apollo lands on the moon. When he lightly mentioned it, you hear boos, and that was curious to me. Of course, growing up, I listened to Gil Scott and Curtis Mayfield. I’ve heard snide remarks about the moon landing in soul songs, but I didn’t realize the disdain was that strong. Once we heard boos, it’s like, whoa, let’s investigate. Unbeknownst to us, CBS Evening News’ Walter Cronkite happened to send a man-on-the-street [reporter]. It was done in a snarky way, like, “While the world stands by to watch history, they’re in the park…”\nI know that is my purpose. No one is more of a sentimental packrat than I am. I am a VHS-collecting, Super 8-collecting archivist. I’ll take all the first five years of Jet Magazine archives, and make my girlfriend angry because five other boxes of Right On! Magazine are in the living room. I was collecting for personal reasons. But I now see that this is important. Once I finished this, everyone was coming out of the woodworks, DMing me like, “Questlove, we have 19 hours of footage of this concert.” Wait, what?! Things I never heard of before. Somewhere between nine to 15 other incredible high-level events were filmed for posterity and rejected, so now it’s in the basement of UCLA or somewhere. I’m keeping my eye on the Universal Hip-Hop Museum that’s opening in the Bronx. I’m hoping they will preserve history. But all too often, Black culture is so easily disposable in every aspect. TikTok content creations, our slang, our music, our style. I guess the attitude has always been: It’s not a big deal. It’s just a dance; it’s just a concert. But it is a big deal. And I realized it was a big deal with our very first interviewee Musa Jackson. Initially, I was concerned because he was 5 years old [during the Harlem Cultural Festival]. What 5-year-old is going to have true insight into the magnitude of what they’re going through? But when he talked to us, he was like, “This is my first memory of life.” He’s 56, 57 now. The common thing was that no one believed. Can you imagine trying to tell people, “Yeah, in Harlem, I saw Sly and the Family Stone and Stevie Wonder”? It’s unbelievable that this could be that easily dismissed.\nWe conducted this interview without any context, no photos, showed him nothing. Just: “Alright, tell us everything you know.” And it was almost like talking to a medium. You don’t believe him because he was spot-on with everything. He knew the Fifth Dimension had on creamsicle outfits. When we showed him the footage, the emotional outpouring started. I realized we’re giving him his life back. Even for Marilyn McCoo [of the Fifth Dimension]. She’s done everything. She was in one of the first Black groups to win a major Grammy. I was wondering, why is this particular show hitting your heartstrings with the millions of things that you’ve done? And suddenly, I realized that she and I had something in common. No matter what job they have, every Black person in their workspace has to juggle code-switching. Between Motown and certain acts that wanted not to make it but survive, you had to code-switch.\nNo example is more obvious than David Ruffin’s performance. It’s in the middle of August. He has on a wool tuxedo and a coat. Why would he do this? And then I thought, man, you’d rather suffer and be uncomfortable in the name of professionalism. That’s something. That was implemented in him via his Motown charm school days. I asked Marilyn McCoo why I’d never seen them be this loose and relaxed at a performance before. She was like, “We’d been dying to perform for Black people for the longest.” At that point, they were the biggest act in the world, bigger than the Supremes. They had the No. 1 song. To them, it’s like, “We had to do this because this is our one chance to get to our people.”\nI’m very shocked that you’re interviewing me [laughs]. That means that a change is happening because this ain’t the Pitchfork of 15 years ago. I didn’t want to compare and contrast to the original Woodstock, but it was only in doing this film that I was like, Ohhh, I get it. Woodstock itself wasn’t the life-changing event. The life-changing event was the Woodstock movie. What made Woodstock great was the fact that we were told that Woodstock was great. I waited a long-ass time to finally open Prince’s autobiography [The Beautiful Ones] because closure is a hard thing. But there’s a chapter where Prince talks about his dad taking him to see Woodstock and Woodstock really speaking to him. He’s 11 years old, sitting in that chair, and he’s like, “This is what I want to do.” I sat there, like, I wonder if this film had come out and been held up in the same light and importance, would this have made a difference in my life?\nThis last year was exhausting, with platform after platform, vehicle after vehicle, series after movie dealing with torture porn, Black pain. I know the intent is to be authentic to the story, but it’s also sending a message that we have a high tolerance for pain. I didn’t realize how important it is to balance it with Black joy. I think about the millions of people out there that could have had their come to Jesus moment with this film like Prince did. Could it have happened? And even if it were completed, what would have been the platform that would have lifted it up? This film is potent enough now to work its magic in ways that it wasn’t allowed to 50 years ago. Black people and history—it’s a painful thing. That plays a role in why it’s easy to forget things. I’m very happy that people see this now. But it’s a deeper well that we have to dig, and this film might be just the beginning of it.\nYes, that we’re even here. We are struggling for a space to exist. I consider myself in that spook who sat by the door position for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. I’ve been there for seven years. Right now, I’m proud that my Harriet Tubman mission at least gets one person in. I feel like I’m ushering one person in at a time, almost like you have to do the Gettysburg Address the night before just to pray that they see your persuasive argument on why Chaka Khan deserves this. I’m trying to use my positioning and my platform now to make real, actual change. In the case of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, initially, I thought, well, it’s not the voting staff. If it were just the 40 of us, it would be the most progressive thing ever because the 40 of us in the room know what time it is. But once the votes go to the general public, it’s like, this guy who was a former label CEO in 1961, is he going to think Janet Jackson deserves her moment? And that’s where things fall apart. So yeah, I’m screaming to the rafters about this actively.\nI was one of those people that was too cool for school. Before my girlfriend moved to the crib, all my awards, all my Grammys, were in the bathroom. Like, “I don’t care, whatever.” And she’s like, “That’s a waste. If that means nothing to you, why do you bust your ass 20 hours a day to run in a maze if this will wind up next to the incense on the toilet? You do care, don’t you?” Right now, I am going through a personal transformation. A lot of us put on this protective shield. Being too cool for school, cynical. This performative defense mechanism that I’m using—is this what it really is? This is from someone who has broken two Grammys and used them as door stops and trained himself to believe that he didn’t care. But I’ll be the first to be like, “Wait a minute, how come we didn’t get invited? What the fuck?” At least as of June of 2021, I do see that celebrating is important. And acknowledging history is very important.\nI mean, I related to that. I told [rock guitarist] Billy Davis, “I’d never, ever seen you sing like a gospel preacher before. I never knew you had a growl in your baritone.” And once Marilyn McCoo started to open up about the pain that it was to play both sides of the fence and getting criticized from both ends—not being Black enough, not being white enough—that hit me. I could relate to that as a person that had to tour opening for the White Stripes and then spend a month and a half with Lauryn Hill. Again, it’s code-switching. It’s an exhausting thing when you can’t just be yourself.\nYou know, at the time when we were working on that segment, “WAP”-gate was happening. And I was trying to explain to friends of mine that, believe it or not, this is nothing new. When Ray Charles was in his stride in 1963, the Black church was upset with him. Mavis explained that we had one foot in the gospel world, but we also had another foot in the blues/folk world. 1969 was this transformative time for everyone, for Civil Rights people, for Black people, especially for the music community in terms of what they were embracing. It was important for me to contextualize certain expressions. The irony of it all is that Jimi Hendrix is the one artist who requested to do this festival and got rejected. Jimi had a strange relationship with the Black community at that time. Like, “He’s a little too wild for us, so he’s on that side of the fence.” He got to a point where he got tired of being the freak-show darling of the industry, so he disbanded his group, got an all-Black group—the Band of Gypsys—and asked [the Harlem Culture Festival], “Can we perform? We want to do a blues set.” And they said no. He’s not even deterred; he winds up booking all the after-shows, so for three weeks, Jimi Hendrix plays at these blues clubs [in Harlem] with Freddie King, his blues mentor.\nWell, I got about six more projects down the pike [laughs]. I need y’all to keep this energy up. The main takeaway is that storytelling is important. I’ve heard Gen Z and millennials say, “All y’all do is diss us, and y’all never talk to us.” The older people are like, “I don’t know what the fuck they saying. That ain’t hip-hop, that’s mumble.” I think generationally speaking, there has to be a meeting in the middle and a real understanding of the culture and not so much disdain for history. Yes, Disney is presenting it through my filter, but it’s also important that we start to take our history seriously. We have to hold our own history up right now.",

The hirsute Roots drummer is a world-class DJ, known for seamless sets, and a well-known musical connoisseur with an overwhelming collection of records. Babies Makin' Babies 2: Misery Strikes Back...No More Babies, like its predecessor, confirms ?uest's credentials. But let's be clear: The first one is a good if somewhat basic get-the-drawz mix; this more complex installment, which effortlessly moves from seeming sad to sounding sweet, is even better.\nA nod to the lovelorn, Babies has its share of blue tunes, like \"Our Love Has Died\", which wallows in self-pity, as Ohio Players' Leroy \"Sugarfoot\" Bonner grieves a failed affair: \"They buried our love, six feet down/ No mourners, no mourners came around.\" His cheerless drawl, set to dirge-like drums, then morphs to full-blown sulk-fest. \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\", which sports a lush guitar, is willfully glum. Al Green is asking that which-- judging by his grief-- is unanswerable; the song's title may as well be \"How Can You Squeeze Blood From a Stone\".\nThankfully, ?uest also includes songs that tell the female side of the story. Syreeta's \"Cause We've Ended Now as Lovers\" is brooding but big-hearted. The Stevie Wonder protégé ponders lost innocence over acoustic soul strumming: \"Lovers walking in the rain/ So close, we feel each other's pain/ But now, you say that love has died away.\" None of the standard reproof (which inflames her male contemporaries) is heard in her quiet contralto. On the other hand, Betty Davis' \"Anti Love Song\" seethes with righteous wrath, proving it takes two to tango.\nWhile Babies feels complete, it still misses some essentials-- Marvin Gaye's \"When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You\" would have worked well here; \"Jessica\", by Herbie Hancock, also comes to mind. Then again, those songs are likely too bleak for Babies, whose most melancholic tracks (\"Our Love Has Died\", \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\") are not as dismal; both songs are sweetened by immaculate production. Likewise, Natalie Cole's \"Good Morning Heartache\" has a technicolor, variety-show grandness that invalidates its woe. At any rate, ?uest achieves a rare combination: a sonic pity party with a soul-soothing sheen.",

But while many of their records have common threads running through them, their new one, undun, is their first attempt at a legit concept album. \"Those other records were thematic records,\" says drummer and musical leader Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson, talking about previous works like Things Fall Apart. \"But all the lyrics on this album are thought in the head of our lead character, Redford Stevens.\"\nThose who have followed this band's increasingly dark path up to now could probably guess that undun's narrative isn't exactly going to be ripe for a rom-com translation anytime soon. It's a character study of an ill-fated, small-time drug dealer that's told in reverse, so that his end is our introduction. As our reviewer Nate Patrin put it, it's \"a story where a man's actual death isn't quite as tragic as the circumstances that pushed him.\"\nWith the new album in mind, we spoke with the ever-knowledgeable ?uestlove about some of his favorite concept albums, and how they expanded his view of what an LP could be.\nDe La Soul: De La Soul Is Dead\nUsually, the definition of a concept album is when the artist tells a story in the second or third person-- they're never a part of the narrative. But, with albums from black artists, I find that they are often involved in the story, sometimes willingly and sometimes unwillingly.\nI rarely hear people refer to De La Soul Is Dead as a concept album and, to be honest, the concept behind it really didn't unravel itself for me until later on. This album is the Emperor's New Clothes-- they're trying to strip off the hippie overtones and the scarlet letter of alt hip-hop. When this album first came out, I was really shocked that they were trying to distance themselves from the very album that gave me direction for what I wanted to do for the rest of my life; I lived by 3 Feet High and Rising and here they are trying to destroy that very dream. It weirded me out.\nBut once I got to know them, I got my geek on and asked them about this record, and it was then that I realized De La Soul \"died for my sins.\" Twenty years ago, a lot of things I do naturally now would be deemed very questionable within the hip-hop environment. But now, I can tell Sufjan [Stevens], \"I'm a fan of your work and I want to work with you on a record,\" without blinking. But back then, De La Soul caught hell from a lot of narrow-minded people. That's when the hip-hop police was alive and absolutely full-fledged. So they were laying down the red carpet upon which I would eventually defecate, sleep, and eat on. [laughs]\nSly and the Family Stone: There's a Riot Goin' On\nI had gotten bleach in my eyes when I was two, and my family had to pin me to the couch and pour a gallon of water on my face as I'm screaming. And the second cut from this album, \"Just Like a Baby\", was playing in the background-- that's how There*'s a Riot Goin' On* entered my life.\nThis is an unwilling first-person concept record, where the viewer is looking at the equivalent of a reality show on wax. Because of the Woodstock publicity and their new-found life as the champions of free love and psychedelic soul, Sly and the Family Stone were the cheerleaders of this new optimistic movement. So everyone was thrown off when this record came out: You're hearing a junkie absolutely wallow in self-pity.\nOr so I thought. When I got to work with Bobby Womack in the late 90s, we spent an hour talking about this record because he was there with Sly as a co-pilot. I was like, \"What was the environment like?\" And he's like, \"Man, Sly is one of the greatest actors of all time. He probably turned that shit in so he could get dropped from the label and get more money off of another label. He was just jivin'.\" And I was like, \"Nah!\" [laughs] In my head, I'm thinking he has the heroin tracks on his arm as he's singing these lyrics, and Bobby Womack is ruining the fantasy. But the results are still there. Whether he's an accidental tourist or one of the greatest actors of all time, Sly invented a new style.\nThe Beach Boys: SMiLE\nThere's a special place in my heart for SMiLE. Various Wilson-heads I've met have compiled stuff and sent me things over the past 10 years, but thank god [The Smile Sessions] box set came out when it did. I was sick from \"Fallon\" for about a week, and all six discs were my soundtrack the entire time. Similar to Riot, I was curious to see how or where Brian Wilson fell off the deep end before the band pulled a coup d'état move and kinda kicked him out. What I heard on the box set was hostility and discontent in the studio, which really starts around disc three, where things get a little more edgy.\nThere's one particular cut where one of the engineers says, \"'Vegetables'! Take 43!\" And someone actually stops and is like, \"Why are we wasting all this tape? We're paying for this! Why don't we just rewind the tape and use it over again?\" And Brian's like, \"Well, I need it for reference.\" And he's like, \"It's a complete waste.\" To me, that's the concept of the record [laughs]-- the absolute madness of Brian Wilson. I really felt like this album could've been subtitled \"Meltdown of a Genius.\"\nMarvin Gaye: Here, My Dear\nMy uncle always had this 8-track inside of his car and, even when I was eight years old, I knew it was too linear for what I was used to from R&B and soul. With a song like, \"When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You\", you don't even get to the chorus until five minutes into it. Once I got older and did some research I realized it was about the meltdown of Marvin's marriage to his cougar wife, Anna Gordy, who was 23 years older than him. He was going to divorce court in the daytime and then freestyling at night. The lyrics are just too raw and honest, like when he screams, \"Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?\" That was one of my favorite lines as a kid. I would always rewind that and get in trouble for it-- my father hated whenever I would discover a curse word on a record because I would just play it over and over and over again.\nProbably the most telling moment on Here, My Dear is on \"Sparrow\", which opens side three. There's a really humorous part where Marvin is wallowing in self pity and is so desperate to talk to anybody that he decides a bird outside of his window is going to be his new best friend. But midway through the song he even starts having doubts about his friendship with the bird, who is not paying attention to him. Marvin actually has to name drop himself to the bird as if that will change its mind. He says, \"Hey bird! Sing to me! I'm Marvin Gaye!\" [laughs]\nErykah Badu: Mama's Gun\nI'm going to let the cat out of the bag: Mama's Gun is definitely a concept record. It's her André 3000 album-- of course, \"Green Eyes\" is so obviously about him. We started it around 1997 or 98, and she was at a really lonely moment. It's really hard for people to admit that they're lonely, and I was actually shocked she would be so bold as to share that. I know she was nervous about André hearing it because he's painfully private and wasn't used to that-- but then that was over once \"Ms. Jackson\" came out. [laughs]\nMy personal participation on this album was a little weird because I was in a relationship at the time, and Erykah is very, very demanding. She'll call you between midnight and seven in the morning and will want you to come down to the studio immediately to change something or to try another idea. My girlfriend at the time really didn't understand it. And, for about 60% of the time I was working on that record, I was really, really, really sick. I remember Erykah giving me a barf trash can [while recording] and I'm like, \"Really? You won't even let me get up from the drum set to throw up?\" [laughs]\nShe definitely knows what she wants. She's one of my hardest clients and the one I always run back to. We argue the most and then everything is fine again at the end of the day. She pushes me harder than any other artist.\nStevie Wonder: Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants\n____Like every other Stevie Wonder fan who purchased Songs in the Key of Life, my father got Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants the first day it came out. He played it at night and I was in bed, so I could hear every song. And the first thing he said to me after he listened was, \"He blew it.\" When it came to music, my relationship with my dad was like Foghorn Leghorn and the little chicken hawk-- he was going to teach me what was and wasn't \"real music.\" He was part of that whole 1977 \"disco sucks\" thing. He stopped buying records then. Whatever he said he hated, I loved.\nI know that most critics frown on the \"departure\" record as an excuse for an artist to somehow humbly admit they can't follow themselves up. And a lot of heads were scratching when Stevie released this album, which I treated as a concept record about nature. It marked a special awakening moment for me because I was used to Stevie's pop magic, so I was a little weirded out that these weren't songs. I often wondered, \"Why would you take such a risk?\" Now, I live that question. [laughs] Who but me is going to test the will and patience of their fan base with every offering? But my personal reasons for doing it have less to do with fear and more to do with restlessness.\nSo I took this album and tried to see what I could do with it. It felt interesting to me. I was eight years old and that was my first headphone experience, the one where I just closed my eyes and imagined what was going on. It was my first black psychedelic experience, if you will.",

Of course, he's been leading the Roots from behind his drum kit for the last 24 (!) years, expanding the assumed limits of hip-hop to a sound that, as he puts it, is \"part Pink Floyd, part Meters.\" But he was also at the infamous 1995 Source Awards that inflamed the simmering East Coast/West Coast rap war of the mid-90s. And he spearheaded the late-90s Soulquarians collective, which found luminaries including D'Angelo, Q-Tip, Erykah Badu, Common, and J Dilla uniting in spirit and practice while chalking up plenty of hits along the way. He backed-up Jay-Z for his 2001 \"Unplugged\" taping-- a controversial move at the time-- bridging the gap between underground and overground. He also made a cameo in the classic \"Chappelle's Show\" sketch \"Electric Guitar, Drums, or Electric Piano\".\nMore recently, he figured out a way to keep his band going and self-sufficient without spending their lives sleeping in tour buses. With the Roots' gig on \"Late Night With Jimmy Fallon\", they quickly staked their claim as the freshest, smartest, and funniest band late-night TV has seen in years. ?uestlove might not rap, but he's still one of hip-hop's best storytellers, and he had plenty of yarns when we spoke with him recently about all of the above-- including the time Puffy screamed on him for an hour and how he bonded with Jay-Z over their mutual love of \"The Simpsons\". One of these days, ?uestlove will write a memoir, and it will be incredible. Consider the following a preview.\nPitchfork: How has your idea of success in the music industry changed over the last 15 years?\n?uestlove: If anyone has had a \"tortoise and the hare\" journey in this industry, it's definitely the Roots. We've been running on the race track for so long that I don't even think we would know what the finish line would feel like. There have been Rocky moments where we felt like we'd run to the top of the stairs and were like, \"We made it!\" But then we noticed that we still had miles to run.\nAt first, it was like, \"OK, if we go gold, we won't complain no more.\" And then it was like, \"OK, we got one Grammy, so we won't complain no more.\" And then it was like, \"If we could do anything but 240 shows a year, we won't complain no more.\" We're more insatiable than we thought. It's just a constant hamster-inside-the-wheel thing that never ever stops.\nOn the other hand, having existed longer than most of the people we started out with back when we first recorded Organix in 1992, there is a feeling that we're happy to be alive. Hip-hop is such a poverty-escape-driven art form. I didn't have that crack-rock, wicked-jump-shot sort of existence that Biggie spoke about, but there were definitely moments where we didn't have gas in my household. I never want to get to that level of poverty where taking a bath has to be a hot-pot experience.\nWhen you first start off, you see what other people have and quietly say, \"I want that.\" Like, \"Oh, Wyclef drives a Spider? I want that. Big Boi has an aquarium inside his bedroom? I want that.\" At 25, my idea of success may have been more vain, like, \"I'll be good the day that there's $20 million in my account and I have this particular house and the wife and 2.5 kids.\" But at 40-- and I know it's kind of silly telling you guys this-- but as long as my Metacritic rating stays above 80, that's all I care about. [laughs]\nPitchfork: Could you have ever anticipated working at a late-night show five years ago?\n?: I wanted it, though I didn't know it was going to come in this form. In 2007, the road was really taking a toll on us. Some people in the group have kids, and those kids weren't newborn babies anymore; the goodbyes at the airport and the tour bus started becoming unbearable to watch. So my manager and I were always like, \"If there was only a way for us to maintain the same money that we're earning now, but stay in one place.\"\nThere are only two places in the United States that would let us do a residency that long: Vegas and Atlantic City. I don't think any of us were ready to be like, \"OK, don't forget to try the fish sticks. Now, here's Otto the Singing Magician!\" at the Showboat in Atlantic City. Ironically, I had just got a house in Los Angeles when I met [Jimmy] Fallon. Cut to five months later, and I'm getting rid of that house and coming back to the East Coast.\nPitchfork: Obviously, \"You Got Me\" was a huge moment for the Roots. Did you ever feel the urge to chase the success of that song more?\n?: If anything, we did quite the opposite. For anyone that's ever had a musical breakthrough in their career, it's always followed by the departure period right after. [Stevie Wonder's] Songs in the Key of Life gave you Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants. [Prince's] Purple Rain gave you Around the World in a Day. [The Beatles'] Revolver gave you Sgt. Pepper's-- which kind of backfired and made them even bigger. It's funny, I can see the science in how music is made with other artists, but it's hard for me to dissect my own thing. It's easy for me to say, \"Oh yeah, that's the self-saboteur move that most artists pull whenever they're afraid.\"\nAnd I just felt like \"You Got Me\" was a fluke-- I never thought one million people would mutually agree to buy this one product of ours. Even at the time it was happening, it didn't feel like a victory. Erykah [Badu] was always the focus; we weren't even the stars of our own song. So I thought, \"This probably isn't going to happen again, so let's try and make like a catalog record displaying everything that we do, and we'll go out guns ablazing.\" We probably made four records in that mindset, and that definitely started with Phrenology. I thought, \"We had our peak, and rap groups don't last more than six records. We'll probably get dropped.\" At some point, we were just thinking of it like a suicide mission, so we did everything with reckless abandon.\nPitchfork: You recently wrote about how listening to Watch the Throne for the first time really stopped you in your tracks. Do you remember the first hip-hop album that made you feel that way?\n?: Definitely [Public Enemy's] It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. I quit my job the day that that came out. I was cutting onions and potatoes as a short-order cook for this 50s-style restaurant chain. I would walk 12 blocks to work everyday, from West Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania, where the restaurant was. Before Nation of Millions, I would usually show up five minutes late. I didn't care, I just had the job to earn extra money so I could buy records.\nBut when I bought that album, my entire walk changed. I wound up getting to work 20 minutes early, simply because you almost had to walk to the bpms of what you were listening to. And by the time that I got there, I just made it to \"Show 'Em Whatcha Got\" and, at work, I couldn't stop singing that sampled horn line from the Lafayette Afro Rock Band. I went on my lunch break and was just like, \"Fuck it, I'm not going back to work.\" So I went to 7-Eleven, purchased about four Duracell batteries, and sat in a park from about 1 p.m. until about 6 p.m., just listening to that record.\nWith [De La Soul's] 3 Feet High and Rising, it was the same thing. That album actually made me feel like, \"Oh, this is where I fit in.\" I found a lifestyle I could adapt to. They also legitimized my fashion sense. I would get teased relentlessly from neighborhood kids and from some school guys-- Tariq [Black Thought] included-- who didn't understand do rags or the holes in my jeans or acrylic paint on my jacket. To them, you didn't take a perfectly good $70 Levi's jacket and draw on it. But once the \"Potholes in My Lawn\" video came out, it made that cool.\nThe Chronic was the opposite effect. Beause I saw everybody going apeshit over it, but it took me three years to finally understand that album.\nPitchfork: How so?\n?: The Chronic represented everything that I hated about hip-hop as a fan, but then later represented everything that I stood for as a musician and engineer. In my head, I thought the Jungle Brothers' \"Straight Out the Jungle\" should be how hip-hop should sound: dirty, gritty, do-it-yourself. But The Chronic sounded clear. [The Jungle Brothers'] Afrika and Mike Gee would tell stories of roaches crawling up on the equipment, flooding in the basement, records getting ruined-- all those things that made hip-hop seem romantic. But I didn't feel like Dr. Dre made The Chronic in his rat-infested basement. I thought, \"You want your records to blend in with Luther Vandross and Ready for the World, don't you?\" I thought hip-hop was a subculture, and we were the antithesis of the mainstream elite. When Chuck D said, \"You singers are spineless/ As you sing your senseless songs to the mindless,\" I was like, \"Yeah, you get it.\" But it wasn't until I started engineering my own stuff that I understood where Dr. Dre was going with it.\nI think people are going through a similar thing with Watch the Throne. I feel like that album might be seen in the way that we see Michael Jackson's Bad, which started his epic phase of creation. Watch the Throne could be the definitive black stadium album.\nPitchfork: You were in the thick of this transition, which happened at the beginning of the last decade, where underground rap and mainstream rap were converging-- like how you played on Jay-Z's Unplugged album in 2001.\n?: Remember when getting with him was such a controversial move? [laughs] We had a two-day summit meeting with our friends and our peers and everything. It was like the riskiest move I ever did in my life: \"Shall I take this call from Jay-Z?\" For obvious reasons, I will say that's the smartest move I've ever made.\nI don't think it's a coincidence that all people who are considered geniuses have a common trait: they sabotage their shit. My circle is a textbook example of that. But Jay's best trait is that he asks questions. He's not afraid to take advice. It's never been a brown-nosey thing with him. He hates that; never do you laugh at the boss' jokes when they're not funny. He's always willing to A-B it: Let's try A, let's try B, and let's even try C, and figure out which one works best. That approach is key to anyone's survival.\nWe're dealing with a kinder, gentler Jay-Z now-- but he really wasn't showing that side back in '99. I mean, he was fresh off the Un stabbing. The perception of him was different back then. But he came to me with zero ego. He's a dude that can give you a hundred \"Simpsons\" quotes, like, \"What you know about the monorail?\" I'm like, \"What?!\" It shows that he's human.\nOf all the people I've worked with, I've never had any huge arguments with Jay. I've walked out on Erykah. I stopped speaking with [D'Angelo] for four years until we started working again recently. Working with the artist elite can be like banging your head against the wall. But what actually makes Jay a true artist is that he has no fear of failure. Half the time, my job is basically to talk people off the ledge. It's more psychological than just me picking up some sticks and counting, \"1, 2, 3, 4.\" I don't have to talk him off the ledge. He'll try something. And if it doesn't work, I'll admit it: \"OK, didn't work. Let's try something else.\"\nPitchfork: That whole Blueprint era seems so crucial now, especially since it was also Kanye West's big emergence as a producer. Did you realize how important it was at the time?\n?: I wonder if I would've felt different about The Blueprint if it weren't released on September 11th. We were in New York that day-- we were almost in a hotel that was four blocks away [from the World Trade Center]. For some strange reason, that hotel lost our reservations, so we were scrambling. Tariq and I ended up staying at the Bryant Park Hotel on 42nd St. And then September 11th went down.\nI don't know why, but the mom and pop electronic store next door to the hotel was still open that morning, and I was like, \"I'ma run down and buy a whole bunch of DVDs for some solidarity time with each other, we can just watch movies.\" As an afterthought, I bought The Blueprint. I could've chosen 14 other records that were released on that day; it's weird how a whole group of people who released albums around then lost their careers-- Macy [Gray], Mariah [Carey], sort of. But everyone bonded over The Blueprint. It hit us at the right time. We were depressed out of our heads, it seemed like we were going through armageddon, and that became the soundtrack to that last quarter.\nSo all that made it much easier to say yes once I stopped laughing at someone telling me that Jay-Z wanted to work with the Roots. I laughed at it for the first hour because I didn't believe it. We were still knee-deep in the us vs. them civil war of Northeast hip-hop.\nPitchfork: Looking back, how real was that civil war between the underground and overground?\n?: [laughs] Well, in the last days of March, 1997-- just three weeks after Biggie was killed-- I remember Mos [Def] hosted a Lyricist Lounge in New York with Q-Tip. He did an a cappella version of Slick Rick's \"A Children's Story\", which is on the Black Star record and is basically about people jacking 80s beats and making them their own, and ruining hip-hop at the same time. Of course, to people at the Lyricist Lounge, the evil villain of hip-hop at that time was Puffy.\nSo Mos gets to the very end of that rhyme: \"Just another case about the wrong path/ Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast, goodnight!\" And he does this freeze. It was like watching Jordan, game six. We are all like, \"God damn!\" And I'm going super over-the-top about this shit, high-fiving, all that.\nYou know the second that Michael Jackson and Ola Ray are surrounded by the zombies in \"Thriller\"? The camera focuses on her, and then she looks at Michael, and now he's a zombie, and then the camera goes backwards before they go into the dance. Well, that's basically what happened to me. Puffy was in my right peripheral, watching me going crazy the whole time. He was 14 deep with dudes dressed in all-black with black sunglasses. I literally went from, \"God damn!\" to \"Oh, fuck.\" [laughs] I thought I was done.\nKeep in mind that this is on the heels of Biggie telling The Source how he had been the biggest Roots fan and took offense to our \"What They Do\" video, which mocked Biggie's \"One More Chance\" video. Listen, I hate videos. I'm meticulous on everything from cover art, fonts, productions, mixing. But when it comes to videos, I just feel so defeated. I don't pay attention. I slept most of the time they filmed \"What They Do\". I really didn't have a clue that we were mocking Biggie. And when we saw the final product, we thought, \"OK, that's silly, go with it.\" [Biggie] didn't like that one bit, boy. I felt horrible that he thought we were even coming at him like that.\nBack to the show-- when I spotted Puffy, Q-Tip just happened to be within reach. Unbeknownst to all of us, Tip had invited Puff so that Puff could sign Mos to Bad Boy. Tip was the only artist that had one foot in the Soulquarian underground and one foot in the champagne rap that was going on at the time. He was the delegate. So anyway, Puff's like, \"Yo, I want a meeting now!\" We went backstage and Tip's playing the role of Minister Farrakhan with me and Mos on the right, and Puffy on the left with his 14 hitmen. That's when I realized how he came into power. It was basically hearing Puff go off like he does at the end of \"My Downfall\" on Life After Death. Screamin' it. He was like, \"Let me tell you something, playboy. Big had nothing but love for y'all motherfuckers! And y'all shitted on him! Y'all shitted on my man!\" I thought we were in the principal's office. And he just went on and on for an hour. Thirty minutes into it, I realized I wasn't going to get killed. It was just strange.\nSo, it was with that apprehension that I took the Jay-Z call. At that point, Jay-Z was definitely part of them, not us. It was a dangerous thing to do. You had to choose sides. But, five minutes into it, I realized it was going to be OK. Doing the \"Unplugged\" thing finally took the scarlet letter off the Roots' lapel. That was the first time we were allowed to play reindeer games with people and not feel like we were outsiders. We were touring Europe most of the time, too. To be honest with you, I didn't even get to meet a lot of hip-hop royalty until maybe five years ago because we were always on the road. No one was ever around.\nPitchfork: During that champagne-rap period, did you legitimately dislike that style of music?\n?: Around that time, the two key figures that I observed the most and had personal stakes in were Dr. Dre and Kurt Cobain. Dre marked the first time that a legitimate hip-hop figurehead was doing big numbers. And then, on the other hand, Kurt was definitely one of the three reasons why we were even allowed to sign to Geffen in '93-- because of all the money that Nirvana generated. Kurt Cobain represents a very legit, realistic outlook. Before that, in my head, to be a white artist was to be privileged. You celebrated the glamor and you got respect. But here's someone that was really taking a hip-hop stance on all of that. Who doesn't play their hit single in concert? Are you crazy? He took that nihilistic Sonic Youth approach, that tortured-everyday-guy thing, to the hilt.\nMeanwhile, Dre definitely served as the blueprint for what would eventually be the black version of that, which is Ready to Die; everyone in that [Bad Boy] camp freely admits that The Chronic was the blueprint for Ready to Die, which it clearly was. The Chronic was grandiose. Prior to that album, hip-hop records would have the token R&B song with a singer on it that was trying to get on the radio. But The Chronic was the first record where that aspect was now blown-out into an album, and the street songs were in the minority. I thought, \"That's cheating, right?\" I was 23. I didn't know any better. I'm still hanging on with my rulebook and my Jungle Brothers records and all my Native Tongue rules. It just wasn't making sense to me.\nThe ideology of what I considered \"real\" hip-hop died at the 1995 Source Awards. I was literally at its funeral-- I sat three rows behind Nas. In the audience, the Bad Boy camp was on the far right, all the West Coast and the Southern rappers were in the middle, and on the far left were all the New York underground rappers like Wu-Tang, Mobb Deep, Nas, Busta Rhymes, and us. That was the day when Suge called out Puffy, and there were fights in the audience. I felt like a bomb was going to detonate.\nNas' body language that day told the whole story of where we were about to go. The more he got ignored for Illmatic, I literally saw his body melt in his seat. Almost like he was ashamed. He just looked so defeated. I was like, \"Yo, he's not gonna be the same after this shit.\" None of us were the same after that day. I feel like the true underground lost its oxygen that night.\nPitchfork: How do you view the Soulquarians era-- when you were working with people like Common, D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Q-Tip, and Dilla-- as part of that underground timeline?\n?: The underground got a boost of adrenaline in '97, which was when we started gathering all the artists we were associated with at MCA Records. The Roots realized that the only way for us to contextually make sense was that we had to have at least ten other acts who were like-minded. There's no such thing as success on an isolated level. OutKast is associated with Goodie Mob and Organized Noise. There was the jiggy movement, the G-funk movement-- everything from Sun Studios to the Motown sound had associated artists.\nBetween '97 and 2003, our home base became Electric Lady Studios, primarily to record D'Angelo's Voodoo. But it really provided us a great reason to have extended slumber parties. It's where we ended up recording Common's Like Water for Chocolate and Electric Circus, Erykah's Mama's Gun, the Roots' Things Fall Apart and Phrenology, parts of Slum Village's Fantastic Vol. 2. Basically, there's 90 seconds in D'Angelo's minute, so if he's going to be at the studio at three, he's going to be there at seven. Which means that, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., me, Dilla, and James Poyser would work on Common stuff, and then we'd start fucking around with D'Angelo from eight until four in the morning. That was an ongoing system for six years. At one point, it just became such a factory that we would create five to seven tracks a day, and then people would just kind of auction on them. So Common was the initial owner of the music to D'Angelo's \"Chicken Grease\" and D'Angelo had \"Geto Heaven, Pt. 2\", and they just traded them. That was the golden era.\nAfter 2001, everyone blew up, which wasn't expected. We all got the success, and then everybody froze. I always thought that we were going to be the Sonic Youth of hip-hop-- that we would never would cross the line ourselves, but we'd be the inspiration for a whole bunch of other cats. And then MCA imploded.\nThe end of it was definitely the Chappelle's Block Party concert. Common and Erykah had broke up, and [director Michel] Gondry's coming to me like, \"Ahmir, you must make them do a song together!\" They didn't want to perform with each other. We had to deal with whether the Fugees were going to show up or not. It was threatening rain.\nKanye was there and, at the time, he was just, like, Usher's opening act. But watching him control his marching band, I knew instantly that he was going to make noise-- just seeing how passionate his black audience was towards him. Of course, every demographic in every sector of the Roots' graph was anything but inner-city black youth. So seeing that power Kanye had, I thought, \"Wow. This is when we're gonna hand the baton to him, and he's going to be the new leader.\" I was OK with it, but I felt a little sad. We had to regroup and start all over again.",

And it is incredible. It's clear that music writers have a special attraction to Thompson because he's one of the more unabashed music geeks to ever walk the earth. In the spheres of the music he loves, which is a very large sphere, he knows all the records, all the tracks, who played on what, what the sleeves looks like. He thinks like a critic and loves reflecting on songs and albums as a listener, ranking records and making lists. He's a student of music and pop culture.\nBut, as the book demonstrates, Thompson is also a wonderful storyteller. Mo' Meta Blues covers his life from his early days in Philadelphia as a child drummer and stage manager for his parents' band to his immersion in hip-hop and the formative years of the Roots. His resume is daunting, endless: co-producer on D'Angelo's Voodoo, binding force for the influential Soulquarians collective, musical director for \"Chappelle's Show\", band-leading fixture on \"Late Night With Jimmy Fallon\" (soon to be \"The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon\"), restaurateur. Along the way, there are encounters with many of his musical heroes, like the time Prince donned a pair of glowing roller skates and dazzled a handful of guests at a Valentine's Day party in Los Angeles.\nWe spoke at NBC Studios in Manhattan last week. When I arrived at Thompson's small office on the sixth floor of 30 Rock-- a space packed with CDs, DVDs, instruments, a TV-- he was sitting at his computer catching up on Twitter while also looking at texts on his phone. Typical multitasking. The interview took place in the NBC cafeteria, where he ate sushi and a seaweed salad for lunch before heading back to prepare for the next \"Late Night\" show.\nPitchfork: You were so immersed in music from an early age, playing and touring with your parents' bands. But at what point did you realize that you were going to make music your life?\nAhmir Thompson: I knew I was going to be a musician. I got my first real drum set at seven, a Vista Light C3 kit that John Bonham had during the Physical Graffiti tour-- one of my dad's drummers got strung out on drugs, and I inherited that set. At that age, I could play drums well enough for an adult to say, \"Play my show.\" I enjoyed it. I liked to travel. I had the knowledge. Technically, I was stage manager at the age of eight.\nI should ask my dad: \"Why did you teach me how to work the soundboard and place the mic settings and cut gels? Was it because you wanted me to take this path or was it to keep me off the streets?\" I think his answer would be more the latter. But it kept me focused on their show, and I was educated. It prepared me. Across the street [gestures out window], at Radio City, when I was 12, the drummer of my father's band got injured. And my dad was confident. He just said, \"You know the show. Do it.\" I became his bandleader at the age of 12.\nBut my dad did not know about [the Roots' 1993 debut album] Organix. It was only midway through Do You Want More?!!!??! when I finally had to come clean and be like, \"All right, I got a record deal and I'm in a group.\"\nPitchfork: You were afraid to tell him?\nAT: Oh, hell yeah.\nPitchfork: It wasn't the kind of music he respected?\nAT: The debut of \"Yo! MTV Raps\" in 1988 was probably the most revolutionary thing to happen to black music since the October '71 debut of \"Soul Train\". And my dad, just being a surface critic, changing channels and seeing the first four seconds of \"Baby Got Back\" or \"Straight Outta Compton\"-- it's not music to him.\nHe sacrificed everything so that I could go to private school. Sometimes bills weren't paid. Sometimes gas was cut off. But my parents made sure I had the best education and drum lessons no matter what. In his head, he wanted me to follow the path of my schoolmates, who would get pulled out of class to go play with Miles Davis. That was my dad's idea of high art. My father wanted me to be a worker, and I dreamed of being an owner.\nBy the time Things Fall Apart came out and we had finally managed to go above the surface, he suddenly saw the light. He knew we were legit. Now, he's our biggest champion. I'm sure that How I Got Over and Undun are still in his CD changer in the car. Getting my father's approval was always like this impossible Mount Fuji mission that I just got to the top of two or three years ago. Now that he sees how I've been able to make a living at this for 20 years, at least, he says, \"I'm very proud of you. You are the greatest thing that happened to me.\" That was the greatest thing I've ever heard in my life.\nPitchfork: Your parents must have done a good job of instilling confidence in you. In the book, there are a lot of places along the way where you could have said, \"Maybe it's time to do something else.\"\nAT: Everyone has those insecure moments. I mean, I'm cool enough to admit it. I don't feel dweebish because I say I have to check my Metacritic rating and make sure it's still above 80 or whatever. I'm a music nerd. I grew up in a room with 300 reviews staring at me from one wall. I'm obsessed with the process. But as far as the confidence, everyone has insecurities. Kanye says he has insecurities. But being a radical doesn't hurt, [never getting] too comfortable. I've never ever been that in a moment in my life where it's like, [sigh of relief] \"This is great.\" I'm always paranoid. Right now, I'm thinking about my third book. [laughs]\nPhoto by Ben Watts\nPitchfork: One snapshot of history that I found particularly interesting was the whole Soulquarians period, where you guys were playing music in a house with Common, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, people who were just starting out and sharing ideas. What do you think when you look back at that?\nAT: I wish I remember enjoying that period. For me, it's a whole bowl of stress, because my house is the default house for which these events happen. It's like those John Hughes 80s films when there's 200 people in mom and dad's house-- I'm worried about my walls. I'm worried about people going through my mail. I'm worried about people lighting their cigarettes, walking on trash cans. Yeah, I'll do my obligatory two, three-hour jamming thing, but I'm also worried about noise ordinances.\nBut in hindsight, that's when [Roots manager] Rich [Nichols] taught us the lesson that you get to contextualize, establish a movement. Besides the one-hit wonder, there's never ever been success in music without the contextualization of being associated with someone else. I don't think it's a coincidence that all these previous hard-to-sell, underground, ignored, not-media-savvy artists were all of a sudden selling one million, two million units during that period of 1998 to 2004: D'Angelo, us, Erykah [Badu], Common, Mos [Def] and [Talib] Kweli. I consider Kanye and Alicia [Keys] to be the steroids version, to the point where they're mainstream artists but they have a left-of-center sense mentality. And now they finish the race and are their own empire.\nBut that's one of the things I'm proud of. The initial nucleus in my circle, the guys that I dubbed the Illadelphonics when I was first doing shows for Jay-Z, all of those guys have split off and now have their own bands. Adam Blackstone basically just runs the world now: he is [musical director for] Jay-Z, Justin [Timberlake], Selena Gomez, Ne-Yo, he runs at least 15 acts. My keyboard player Omar [Edwards] has got seven: Mary J. Blige, Rihanna, Kanye, Timbaland. Pretty much if you are at stadium status and you're touring, your band has to come through that circle. Those same frickin' 14-, 15-, 16-year-olds that used to abuse my PlayStation when I came home off tour and left my house smelling like corn chips with their socks are now running empires, which is amazing to me.\nPitchfork: You have some great stories in there about Prince-- especially the roller rink party on Valentine's Day.\nAT: That was the coolest, safest Prince story I could tell. Ninety-five percent of the other times was us playing music, and there's no story in that. He's insanely private. I figured since he already has those boots that light up when he walks, then there's no revelation if you have a pair of roller skates that make you look like an extra in Xanadu!\nHere's the funniest thing about that story: Eddie Murphy's [at \"Late Night\"] last November to promote that movie he did with Ben Stiller, Tower Heist. When some real A-list stars come in, all the hallways are quiet and you can hear a pin drop. It's real tension. Usually, when the Megan Foxes of the world-- or anybody in that top half of the Maxim list-- are here, all of a sudden it's quiet as a mouse. Other cats, like Springsteen, just come here and pop in our room without knocking, sit down, talk to us. That's regular.\nSo when Eddie was here, he was in the hallway-- and there's at least 80 people in that hallway-- and it was deadly silent. He's just standing there and it's a real awkward moment. I said, \"Can I talk to him for a second?\" Then: \"Hey, it's such an honor for you to be here. I gotta ask you a question. I don't know if you remember, but Valenti...\" And I swear I did not even get the entire word \"Valentine's\" out of my mouth, and he says, \"roller skates!\" [laughs] The recapping of the story was almost better than the experience, because that made me look like the coolest person at 30 Rock. All of a sudden it was just he and I in our own world, and we were laughing so hard that everyone else started laughing.\nI have like nine UFO stories, which is basically a story that no one's ever going to believe. Like if my ex wasn't with me on Valentine's Day, I would tell the story to no one, because they would just say, \"You're making it up.\" It was like [Eddie] and I were Vietnam veterans or something, like we were in the same platoon. I was like, \"Yo, man, do you realize how hard it is to get people to believe that story? How many times I've had to call my ex to verify that, like, 'Yes, we were there. And, yes, Prince had on the roller skates.'\"\nEddie added to the story. Everyone pretty much knows that Prince's Jehovah's Witness conviction is strong. So at one point, Eddie says that Prince [skated] past him going backwards and said [making the two-fingers-across-eyes Prince sign], \"When are you going to give your life to Jehovah, Eddie Murphy?\" [laughs]\nPitchfork: And Prince was just a figure of grace in those skates, right?\nAT: Amazing. I heard he has a near-200 bowling game, too. Prince let us take over Paisley Park for about two weeks-- he gave Common free use of the studio while he was on the road. It was the most surreal thing. There's so many gnomes and busts and over-the-top illustrations of his face alone. And I swear to God, if you're walking in the dark and there's white walls with black paintings, it's like the eyes are following you. There was a point where I was feeling the wall to see if there were hidden cameras.\nPitchfork: You've had a chance to work with a lot of people who you grew up idolizing. Was there a point along the way when you became unfazed by that?\nAT: Well, I had one regret about this book coming out so soon-- the lesson that I learned doing Al Green's Lay It Down record. He's an eccentric genius, and I think that if you are this supremely gifted artist, then there will checks and balances-- something else will be missing.\nSo there's this point where my whole thing was to go kind of nouveau retro and take him back to a more natural, soulful place, closer to Willie Mitchell, below the Mason-Dixon Line kind of thing. And we had a really good groove going for the first three months of creating and writing the music. Then Al gets on this tangent, he says, \"Stevie wrote us a song.\" Instantly, I'm like, \"Even if I were to do a Stevie Wonder song, it's not gonna sound like it's a Memphis song. There's a certain groove we have. This record's coherent this way and now you're talking about a Stevie Wonder song?\" He said, \"Yeah, man! Stevie Wonder's 'I Love You Too Much'-- that was my song!\" Now I'm thinking, \"Wait a minute! That's the second song on In Square Circle, from 1985. I don't wanna cover that song! That song has nothing to do with what we're doing texture-wise.\" We kinda shrugged it off. Then later, we needed a cover song. [Al said], \"Hey! I've got a cover song! Stevie Wonder wrote me a song called 'I Love You Too Much'.\" And I said, \"Yeah, we know, we know!\" So I think, \"Well, we can try it out and he'll forget about it.\" And he forgets about it.\nThree months later, we've got 10 songs. [Al says], \"What about Stevie? I wanna do that.\" Basically, Al became the little boy that cried \"I Love You Too Much\". For three years, from 2003 to early 2006, that's all he kept talking about, to the point where it just became the running joke behind his back. [The cover did not end up on Lay It Down.]\nNow, cut to like two months ago. A friend of mine [who works at a label] gets a call from a storage facility in Philadelphia that alerts him to the fact that payments on a storage unit are long overdue and that they're gonna shut it down and trash all these reels they had in there. And there's a lot of reels! They said, \"We know that some of these artists are on your label, so you might want to see about this.\" And they run off names like Bowie and Stevie Wonder. So I tell my friend, like, \"Yeah, send the Stevie reel.\" There are seven songs on there, and the date on one of the songs is September 11, 1977. It's a duet with Al Green-- \"I Love You Too Much\"! And this shit sounded like a Memphis song! I call Rich up, I'm like, \"Yo! He was telling the truth!\" Oh, man! I was so sick, like, all the time we was clowning him about this non-existent thing: \"Suuuure you did a song with Stevie.\"\nPitchfork: Are there other music memoirs that inspired you for this book?\nAT: The two I loved the most also broke my heart the most. Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye was extremely haunting. And Brian Wilson's book [Wouldn't It Be Nice] was really heartbreaking. After reading that, I didn't know if I had a story that was interesting enough. I thought, \"Did I suffer for my art enough? What am I gonna do when I get to chapter eight?\"\nI'm neurotic about it, but somehow, I managed to read my book. It's one thing when you write it and email stuff in and they send you the drafts back with corrections and all that stuff. But then I'm reading it and I'm almost at the end. For a few moments, I actually kinda read it third-person. I was like, \"OK. This guy is interesting.\"",
