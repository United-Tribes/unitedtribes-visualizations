Festivalgoers who had bought VIP access were rushing into the exclusive terrasses and searching for any spot where there might be shelter. Fans hid under tables and held stools over their heads as they waited out the storm.\nTrending on Billboard\nWhen it comes to booking a festival the size and scope of Osheaga, there’s a lot you can control — and a lot you can’t. One is the weather. Another is when an artist happens to break.\nIn some ways, the team at Evenko, the Quebec promoters behind the Montreal music festival, has gotten almost too good at predicting the next big thing.\nAbrams wouldn’t have been playing that slot if not for her explosion over the last year. Farkas says the singer-songwriter was booked over a year and a half ago, originally to play in the earlier afternoon, but was elevated to sub-headliner status after her popularity as an opener on Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour propelled a major breakthrough. Her hit “That’s So True” rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 last year. Ironically, she didn’t get to play it because of the rain.\nIt’s nothing new for Osheaga. Last year, Chappell Roan played in the heat of the mid-afternoon sun for what felt like the biggest set at the festival — including headliners.\n“Sure, it would have been great to move her later, but I love the fact that there were 40,000 people there to see it,” says Farkas. “I love the fact that she played before Rancid. I love everything about it.”\nOsheaga has become excellent at predicting who’s going to take over the Canadian charts even before it happens. Alex Warren has had the No. 1 hit on the Canadian Hot 100 for 17 weeks and counting with “Ordinary.” Similar to Roan last year, he got to perform it early in the day for a crowd of young fans who had arrived early to hear it.\nA previous long-running chart topper, Shaboozey, played his former No. 1 hit “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” twice in a row.\nThen, there’s Doechii.\n“We booked her right as she was blowing up,” says Farkas. “Now, she’s getting Grammys and really exploding.”\nNone of these artists were officially headliners. That designation went to The Killers, Tyler, The Creator and Olivia Rodrigo. But Evenko’s long-term booking has created value all throughout the lineup.\nRead more on Osheaga’s unique booking strategy and how it became one of Canada’s biggest music festivals here. — Richard Trapunski\nThe Weeknd Sets a Record for Most Shows By a Canadian Artist at Toronto’s Rogers Centre\nThe Weeknd has made history in his hometown.\nThe artist born Abel Tesfaye has set a record for most shows by a Canadian artist at the Rogers Centre, the Toronto stadium that is also home to the Blue Jays.\nHe also set a record for most shows at the venue by a male solo artist on the same tour. He’s played six shows there on the After Hours Til Dawn Tour, including two in 2022.\nThe Weeknd wrapped up four dates at the venue he still calls by its classic name, SkyDome — all sold out.\n“We sold out the SkyDome, four nights. This is the last show,” he said last Friday (Aug. 8) before launching into “Take My Breath.”\n“I just have one favour to ask you. I want them to hear us all the way from Scarborough, all the way from Mississauga.”\nIt’s likely the Scarborough-born Tesfaye’s last hometown concert under the name The Weeknd, which he has teased he is retiring after the After Hours Til Dawn Tour. At these shows, which took place July 27-28 and Aug. 7-8, he made his time in the city count.\nOn Aug. 8, The Weeknd invited youth from the Boys and Girls Club of West Scarborough to join him backstage.\nA few days earlier, on Aug. 6, Tesfaye hosted a special Ethiopian coffee ceremony with his mother, Samra, and family in celebration of his Samra Origins collaboration with Nespresso.\nThe previous weekend, in advance of his first two shows, Tesfaye received the key to the city of Toronto from Mayor Olivia Chow. At the ceremony, he and Live Nation committed to support the Boys & Girls Club of West Scarborough, helping to revitalize the basketball court and bring a mobile recording studio to the organization that helped shape him. He’s also supporting Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute, helping to build a media arts and robotics computer lab, a dedicated dance and arts studio and a sensory room for students with developmental disabilities.\nThe Weeknd project began in Toronto 15 years ago, and it may be moving onto a new phase soon. In the meantime, Tesfaye made sure to give it a proper sendoff.\nRead more here. — R.T.\nGuess Who Is Coming Back? Randy Bachman & Burton Cummings Return With Their Classic Band Name\nGuess Who is returning?\nFor the first time in over twenty years, Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings, the principal songwriters of that legendary Winnipeg rock band, will be performing together as The Guess Who.\nOn Jan. 31, 2026, The Guess Who will take the stage at Fallsview Casino in Niagara Falls, Ontario, with more shows to be announced soon.\nOver the years, the dynamic duo of Bachman and Cummings have often performed together, as Bachman-Cummings, and played their classic Guess Who material, but not under that name, because of a long legal dispute with other former members of the band.\nThe long-standing dispute over the band name The Guess Who began in 1978 when former bassist Jim Kale (fired from the group in 1972) asked Cummings for permission to use the name for a single reunion concert. That was given, but in 1987, Kale discovered that the name The Guess Who had never been trademarked, and he filed registration applications with the United States trademark office for it.\nAfter securing that trademark, Kale assembled a band of other musicians, called them The Guess Who, and toured extensively under that name, until very recently. The resulting confusion over the name brought bitter feelings and an eventual lawsuit.\nLast year, Billboard reported that the Guess Who settled the bitter trademark lawsuit in which two bandmates referred to a recent iteration of the group as nothing more than a “cover band.” Under the deal, Bachman and Cummings said they will acquire full control over the trademark to the band’s name.\nThe case of The Guess Who is now often cited as an example of the importance of properly trademarking a band name. In a guest column in Billboard Canada, Canadian entertainment lawyer Chad Finkelstein observed, “For musicians, stage names are extremely important — and also surprisingly fragile. In the case of The Guess Who, souring personal and creative relationships have had legal ramifications because of a lack of protections.\n“For musicians, a stage name or band name is not just a label, but a symbol of the artist’s persona, style and the emotional connection they create with their audience,” Finkelstein continued. “It’s often the cornerstone of their brand identity.”\nRead more here. — Kerry Doole",

Billboard staffers discuss these questions and more below.\nTrending on Billboard\n1. Chappell Roan’s “The Subway” debuted at No. 3 on the Hot 100 this week. Is that higher, lower or about where you would have expected this song to debut?\nHannah Dailey: Given how long it took for her to release “The Subway” after first performing it at Gov Ball — 14! Months! — I’m pleasantly surprised that “The Subway” debuted as high as it did. Though I feel confident it would have had a straight shot to No. 1 if she’d released it a year ago when everyone was still freshly caught up in the Chappell craze, at this point, I would’ve expected it to enter the chart in the mid- or lower top 10 range. She and her team should be really happy.\nStephen Daw: Just a little bit lower than I’d initially thought. After seeing the massive streaming numbers this song was pulling in during its first few days, I thought it had a better-than-average chance of taking the top spot on the Hot 100. Still, though, debuting a song at your highest chart position to date is no small feat!\nKyle Denis: This is a bit higher than I expected! “The Giver” was fairly divisive, but clearly not enough to overshadow the anticipation for “The Subway.” It also helps that “The Subway” debuted alongside its exceptional music video, marking Chappell’s first proper music video since “Hot to Go” two years ago.\nLyndsey Havens: My instinct was to say higher, but as I think about it, a No. 3 debut is pretty much exactly what I’d expect for “Subway” for two reasons. It’s a natural debut spot for Roan, who has become something of a chart mainstay these last couple of years. Plus, given the more ballad-inspired nature of the song, it fits in perfectly with what else is resonating right now — look no further than previous chart-topper, “Ordinary” by Alex Warren. “The Subway” comes at the right time in both popular music and Roan’s career, as it shows yet another side of the multidimensional pop star, one that’s softer and showcases her incredible vocal prowess — proving that not all hits need to be burning “h-o-t.”\nJason Lipshutz: Higher. Considering that “The Giver” was Roan’s first post-Midwest Princess release, was teased with more fervor than “The Subway” and sounded more uptempo and radio-friendly, I expected that song’s No. 5 debut to serve as a bar that “The Subway” could not hurdle. Yet fans seem to be responding more positively to “The Subway” than to its predecessor, with a huge streaming bow powering an even higher chart launch. As a fan of the new single, I’m pleasantly surprised that “The Subway” is now Roan’s highest-charting hit.\n2. Was “The Subway” worth the hype? Is it a worthy follow-up to “The Giver?”\nHannah Dailey: Yes and yes. From the sharp lyrics to Chappell’s stunning vocal delivery — and of course, that glorious outro that hits just as hard as the first time you heard it every time you press “play” — this song is truly a fantastic piece that stands apart from everything else in the top 40 right now in the best way. “The Giver” is a great song, but everything about the rollout for “Subway” feels way more thoughtful and complete. I definitely think she leveled up here.\nStephen Daw: This song absolutely met and surpassed my expectations, and is a phenomenal improvement on what she set up with “The Giver,” all the way down to her strategy when rolling it out. She and Dan Nigro managed to keep the soul of the song intact while changing around some arrangements and adding small production flourishes to make the studio version stand apart from her live performances. Even fans who have been listening to bootlegged live versions for well over a year will keep going back to the studio recording to find the new bits they love.\nKyle Denis: I think so! I can already tell this will have more staying power than “The Giver” on both my daily personal playlist and the Hot 100. Quite simply, “The Subway” is a better execution of Chappell’s vision than “The Giver.” The latter attempted to capture arena-sized Shania Twain-esque country-pop but lacked the necessary punchiness; the former effectively channels the yearning timbre of The Cranberries’ Dolores O’Riordan. “The Subway” isn’t just a worthy follow-up to “The Giver,” it’s also one of my favorite pop songs of the year so far.\nLyndsey Havens: Totally. “The Subway” is a really gorgeous song — and both from a skillset and thematic point of view, it follows “The Giver” nicely. Much like “Subway,” “Giver” showed an entirely new country side of Roan. And I think any fan appreciates when an artist not only walks a new path, but pulls it off this well. Lyrically, you could argue that there’s a thread between giving too much in a relationship that results in losing the girl (“Subway”) — but that’s just one line of thinking. The main takeaway, I think, is that Roan isn’t leaving any stone unturned when it comes to her sonic evolution, and how lucky are we to be along for that ride?\nJason Lipshutz: “The Subway” better showcases Chappell Roan’s respective skill set than “The Giver”: whereas the latter was marked by winking innuendos and genre exploration, “The Subway” utilizes the pop star’s knack for sweeping emotion, presented here in a lush alt-pop landscape and accentuated by a heart-wrenched outro. If “The Giver” felt like an unexpected detour, “The Subway” centers Chappell and sounds like it could become one of her defining songs. So, yes, very much worth the hype.\n3. “The Giver,” Chappell’s only other release of 2025 so far, debuted at No. 5 and spent just eight weeks on the Hot 100. Do you expect “The Subway” to stick around a little longer?\nHannah Dailey: I definitely think this song has the capacity to be a lasting hit, especially if Chappell continues to promote it. I could see it easily locking down a semi-permanent spot in the top 10 or maybe even reaching No. 1 at some point. But even if she does just let “The Subway” chug along on its own following this initial round of promo, I’ll be surprised if it completely falls off the chart any time soon. That outro is just too addicting; fans aren’t going to quit listening on repeat for a long, long time.\nStephen Daw: I think so. While “The Giver” was (and still is) a great song, it felt like Chappell and her team put a lot of effort into the weeks leading up to the track’s release, and then offered little else once fans had the song. The way they approached “The Subway,” meanwhile, has felt different, and its release felt much more like an event that got fans around the world talking. If she can get more radio stations to start picking this song up in the coming weeks, I could see “The Subway” becoming a runaway hit that hovers around the top 40, much like “Pink Pony Club” has continued to do for this entire year.\nKyle Denis: I definitely think “The Subway” will stick around longer than “The Giver.” Theoretically, “Subway” shouldn’t have to battle against a “Pink Pony Club” re-peak, and sonically, it’s far more in line with the sound fans and casual listeners have come to expect from Chappell. With a music video in tow and radio already latching on, I expect “The Subway” to stick around well into the fall.\nLyndsey Havens: Not necessarily. With the music video already out, I wouldn’t be surprised if it enjoys a similar lifespan on the chart. And in a way, I wouldn’t be mad if it falls off soon… only because Roan has proven that good things always come back around. And I have no doubt that if and when these songs end up on a project, their staying power will be much stronger.\nJason Lipshutz: Yeah, “The Subway” sounds like the more enduring hit. Although “The Giver” has the hook and tempo of a country-pop track that could cross over to top 40 radio, “The Subway” contains the emotional wallop that made “Pink Pony Club” a months-long smash for Roan. Make no mistake — as a fan, I want Chappell to keep taking left-field chances like “The Giver” and expand her aesthetic. Yet “The Subway” exists more squarely in her pocket of commercial success, so I’d expect it to be around the upper reaches of the Hot 100 for a bit.\n4. Chappell recently confirmed that her second album isn’t coming anytime soon. How do you anticipate that might impact the long-term performance of “The Subway”?\nHannah Dailey: It’s very possible that people’s hype for “The Subway” will die down more quickly now that we know it’s not directly leading to a Midwest Princess follow-up, but… I almost wonder if removing that anticipation from the equation will actually enable fans to enjoy the song even more than they would have otherwise. Without any album noise diluting the conversation, people can just appreciate “The Subway” for what it is, coming back again and again and getting more out of the song than they would have if they’d just been treating it as merely one taste of a bigger project to come.\nStephen Daw: With the single-into-album release structure most artists take today, that leads to pretty natural boosts for singles on the charts once the album they’re a part of is out. So, Chappell not releasing an album for a little while could very well mean that “The Subway” doesn’t get the elongated shelf-life that her fans would want to see for it. But, stranger things have happened on the charts — a fictional K-pop band is currently locking down the No. 1 spot! Anything can happen!\nKyle Denis: As it stands, I think it can go either way. “Good Luck, Babe!” became one of her defining hits without ever being attached to a larger project, so “Subway” could certainly replicate that trajectory. On the other hand, if “Subway” peters off a bit earlier than expected, an album release almost always gives the focus singles a second wind. Right now, I’m of the mind that “Subway” will be just fine without an album on the horizon.\nLyndsey Havens: Though I doubt it’s intentional, I think the long wait can only benefit any singles that come until the album. We’ve seen how well Chappell does over time; in fact, the lengthy timespan between the release of The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess and its chart success is a huge part of Roan’s story as a rising star. If there is a long gap between these singles and an album — assuming they will even be on her next project — that only helps them to be enjoyed all over again.\nJason Lipshutz: It’s tough to say, since streaming listeners aren’t likely to play a song more or less often due to the rumored release window of its host album. If we don’t get any new Chappell music for a while following “The Subway,” that may extend its mainstream shelf life, since it will have less competition from other potential songs from her highly anticipated Midwest Princess follow-up. But if we do get a new album sooner rather than later, “The Subway” might be one of the stronger tracks on it! I think that, whether Roan is telling the truth about her second album or if she’s setting up fans for a surprise, “The Subway” is going to stand on its own as a hit single.\n5. “Good Luck, Babe!” and “Pink Pony Club” both peaked at No. 4 on the Hot 100. What advice would you give Chappell to get “The Subway” to the top spot and claim her first No. 1 single?\nHannah Dailey: Get on TV and sing. That’s it. “Good Luck, Babe!” and “Pink Pony Club” both took off with a lot of help from Chappell’s string of magnetic festival sets in 2024, because there’s a special sort of magic that’s embedded into each one of her songs that doesn’t fully unlock until she performs them live. If we could just get one definitive performance of “The Subway” on a late-night show, there would be no stopping this song.\nStephen Daw: Outside of pushing for more radio play, I’d love to see her start performing this song live in as many formats as she possibly can. Morning shows? Late-night talk shows? The upcoming MTV Video Music Awards? I think making her voice inescapable could make a big difference for the future of “The Subway.”\nKyle Denis: This is the kind of song that just needs one major performance, preferably one that airs on national TV. Chappell could easily shut down the VMAs or any fall or winter awards show with a rousing performance of “Subway.” After that bridge/outro gets its big moment, it’s outta here!\nLyndsey Havens: Keep us waiting, girl. (Mostly) everything about Roan’s rise has felt slow and steady — at least from the outside looking in — so there’s no reason to rush anything now or push for promotional tactics that feel inauthentic. I wouldn’t be shocked if, over time — even if it takes five years, as she teased of her second album’s timeline — “The Subway” gains in all metrics naturally. As Roan said herself on “The Giver,” “I get the job done.” And I have no doubts about that.\nJason Lipshutz: We need an epic live performance of “The Subway” — which we already got last summer, when Roan debuted the track in front of various festival crowds. Now that a studio version of the song has been released, however, let’s hope a splashy primetime performance (maybe at the upcoming VMAs?) helps its momentum surge, and “The Subway” becomes a very worthy first chart-topper for Chappell.",

And according to her, it doesn’t help that all three of the singles she’s released since dropping debut album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess have completely different sonic styles, from the country-fried “The Giver” to the ’90s rock-inspired “The Subway.”\n“I just think that ‘The Giver,’ ‘Good Luck, Babe!’ [and] ‘The Subway,’ they’re all kind of so different,” Roan began. “So that’s why I’m just like, ‘I have no idea what the next era is.’ That’s the scary part of putting out new music and then people not liking it, because it’s not like the music you made before.”\n“It makes you scared to release stuff,” she continued. “You’re like, ‘Well, people aren’t ever going to like it as much as the first one.’ That’s the risk you take every single time.”\nTrending on Billboard\nThe interview comes about a week after Roan first curbed lofty fan expectations by telling Vogue that no, she won’t be releasing another album any time soon, despite the pressure to follow up the success of Midwest Princess. “The second project doesn’t exist yet,” she said at the time, noting that it could take up to five years to complete CR2. “There is no album. There is no collection of songs.”\nThat said, Roan does think that her latest single, “The Subway” — which arrived Aug. 1 and recently gave the star a career high debut on the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 3 — will be a “safe” transition from Midwest Princess to whatever comes next. “I think it’s a good ring on the ladder,” she said of the track, which she also revealed to Lowe was actually written about her experiences in Los Angeles, despite its distinct New York City imagery.\n“‘The Subway’ is just so much more romantic,” she explained. “But it was actually about me hiding in Los Angeles from someone who I was deeply in love with. We weren’t on bad terms, it was just kind of trying to avoid the coffee shops that we went to and parties. And so that’s where it came from, was, ‘Oh my God, I don’t know how to exist in this city.’ I felt pretty lonely there for many years.”\nPlus, no matter which styles Roan employs on her next album, the commercial success of her three post-Midwest Princess songs — each of which reached the top 5 of the Hot 100, despite their differences — proves that fans are all but guaranteed to love it. And while breaking molds can be scary, the Missouri native says that experimenting with different genres is “one of the most admirable things an artist can do.”\n“When Gaga released Joanne, and just was like, ‘Oh, I actually have this entire other side of me outside of pop,’ that just builds the character of your artistry,” Roan told Lowe.\nRoan’s full interview with Lowe will arrive on Apple Music 1 soon.",

Since that performance — which she repeated at a number of other festivals and live dates over the subsequent year-plus — fans have been clamoring for an official studio version. And after about a week of teasing, on last Thursday (July 31) at 8:00 p.m. ET, they finally got it, along with a new music video that followed the next morning, thus marking the fullest rollout we’ve gotten for a new Chappell Roan single since she became a superstar early last year.\nTo mark the occasion, we’re bringing back the Rollout Report Card — which we first debuted back in March to discuss the full release of Lady Gaga’s Mayhem album — to talk both about “The Subway” as a song and as the center for an entire promotional era. Host Andrew Unterberger and Billboard Pride editor Stephen Daw return from that episode, and we’re joined by Billboard writer Hannah Dailey, who was in attendance for Roan’s Gov Ball “Subway” debut (and has been watching the video she took of it for the last 14 months while anxiously awaiting the studio version).\nTrending on Billboard\nOver the course of our discussion, we give Roan letter grades for everything from the timing of the “Subway” rollout to the coherence of the entire promo push, while also debating many of the most pressing questions around the official song: Did it need to take so long? Did it improve on the live version? Does the video live up to our expectations of what we’d always hoped for a big-budget Roan visual? Should the song’s outro have actually been a bridge? What are our expectations for the song’s chart performance?

This week, for the upcoming Billboard Hot 100 dated Aug. 16, we look at whether Chappell Roan’s new single will be able to get into the mix with KPop Demon Hunters and Alex Warren in the fight atop the Hot 100.\nChappell Roan, “The Subway” (KRA/Amusement/Island/Republic): Like New Yorkers anxious to get to work on time, Chappell Roan’s fans had been waiting for “The Subway” far longer than they’d initially expected. Roan had debuted the song at a couple live dates in summer 2024, but for the next year, there was no indication of an imminent studio release. Then finally, last month, reports of Chappell filming a new music video in New York began to circulate, followed by an official announcement weeks later that the song would finally arrive on the evening of Thursday, July 31, with an official video to follow Friday morning.\nFans were certainly ready for the dreamy new song, which debuted atop the Spotify Daily Top Songs USA chart — with over 3.9 million streams in its first full day of release, a high for 2025 — while also briefly topping the iTunes real-time chart, and shooting to the top of YouTube’s Trending chart for music once its video was released the next morning. (The song’s impact on the Apple Music real-time charts has been somewhat less, as it has thus far peaked at No. 6.) The song’s daily numbers have perhaps inevitably receded from that first-day boom, but remain robust, with “Subway” reigning for most of the week on the Spotify daily chart.\nTrending on Billboard\nWill it be enough for “The Subway” to pull in atop the Hot 100? That might be a challenge, as it will not be getting any help from physical sales — the vinyl single of the song sold on Roan’s website is currently scheduled to ship “on or before Halloween” — and not much support yet from radio, though the song has early boosters in SiriusXM’s Hits 1, iHeartMedia’s WIHT Washington, D.C., and Cox Media Group’s WBLI Long Island, N.Y., with far more stations still playing her enduring hit “Pink Pony Club” (No. 11 on Radio Songs this week).\nBut if the new song can gain a little extra momentum on streaming late in the week, and maybe find a small extra boost or two — like Roan’s Island labelmate Sabrina Carpenter did on her way to a No. 1 debut for “Manchild” a couple months ago — it’s not impossible that “Subway” could find its way to the top. And regardless, a debut in the top three seems very likely, which would make the song the highest-charting of Roan’s career, passing the shared No. 4 peaks of current signature hits “Good Luck, Babe!” and the aforementioned “Pink Pony Club.”\nHUNTR/X, EJAE, Audrey Nuna & Rei Ami, “Golden” (Visva/Republic): It’s six weeks now into the pop culture takeover of KPop Demon Hunters, and against all odds, the soundtrack is still growing. The Netflix soundtrack currently claims the No. 2 spots on both the Billboard 200 (with the full film soundtrack) and the Hot 100 (with HUNTR/X’s “Golden”), with the gaps shrinking every week between it and Morgan Wallen’s I’m the Problem and Alex Warren’s “Ordinary” on the two charts, respectively.\nIt’s a little closer to clearing that final hurdle on the Hot 100, with “Golden” having long lapped “Ordinary” on DSPs — it’s now led Streaming Songs for two weeks — and also sitting right behind it on the Digital Song Sales chart this week (Nos. 4 and 5, respectively). The question of radio remains, but “Golden” is also starting to really make its presence felt there: the song is up 73% in plays Aug. 1-4 over the same period the week before, according to Luminate, and approaching the top 25 on Pop Airplay next week.\nIf “Golden” continues to surge, this could be the week it has its moment atop the Hot 100.\nAlex Warren, “Ordinary” (Atlantic): Don’t count out “Ordinary” just yet: After finally starting to slip in radio airplay last week, the nine-week Hot 100 No. 1 has rebounded slightly this week, and the song should secure an eighth week atop the Radio Songs chart. This is happening while his subsequent single “On My Mind” with ROSÉ is also gaining in airplay and his brand-new “Eternity” is also drawing some early radio attention. And like “Golden,” “Ordinary” has been discounted to 69 cents on iTunes for this tracking week — and is benefiting from buzz over his and Luke Combs’ Lollapalooza performance of the song – meaning Warren and his team are still hoping to secure that benchmark 10th week atop the Hot 100 before potentially falling to Roan or HUNTR/X.",

The pop star has revealed that it could be several years before she completes a follow-up to 2023’s The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.\nWhile speaking to Vogue in a piece published Monday (Aug. 4), Roan shared that he has no plans to accompany new single “The Subway” with an LP any time soon. “The second project doesn’t exist yet,” she told the publication. “There is no album. There is no collection of songs.”\n“It took me five years to write the first one, and it’s probably going to take at least five to write the next,” she continued. “I’m not that type of writer that can pump it out … Even if I was in the studio 12 hours a day, every single day, that does not mean that you would get an album any faster.”\nTrending on Billboard\nIt’s not the first time Roan has touched on the fact that it could be a while before she completes her next full-length, though fans have at times been hopeful that it would come sooner as the Missouri native has released various tracks over the past year. On the first day of August, she dropped long-awaited ballad “The Subway,” which followed March’s Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hit “The Giver.” And last year, she released “Good Luck, Babe!,” which would become her breakout single.\nIn July, however, as Roan announced that she would be playing a series of pop-up shows in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City, she told fans that she “wanted the chance to do something special before going away to write the next album,” implying that she hadn’t yet started the bulk of the work on a new LP.\nThough it sounds like the vocalist is going to take her time making CR2 perfect, it’s hard to imagine how she could top Midwest Princess. Released in September 2023, the album slowly gained traction before reaching its peak at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 in August the following year. It also earned Roan her first-ever Grammy, with the star taking home best new artist at February’s awards.\nAmid the whirlwind of sudden global fame, Roan has been open about how her mental health has suffered, at one point speaking out against toxic fan behaviors. In her interview with Vogue, however, she said that she’s finally learned how to balance her career with her personal life and well-being — and one important way of doing that has been deleting social media apps off her phone.\nThat means that whenever her next album does arrive, it won’t be informed by the scrolling world. “I’ve never written an album where I don’t have Instagram or anything,” she told the publication. “The album process is purely, only mine. No one on TikTok gets to see it.”",

Here are 11 artists who've paid tribute.\nsitename: Billboard\ndate: 2025-08-04\ncategories: ['Pop']\ntags: ['new york city']\n---\nWhen you think of New York City landmarks, the Statue of Liberty, Times Square and the Brooklyn Bridge all come to mind. But there’s one quintessential part of the city that often gets overlooked, despite the fact that countless locals use it pretty much every day: the subway.\nLove it or hate it, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s citywide public transit system is a crucial part of what makes New York, well, New York. With tracks stretching across the five boroughs, the subway is more than just something that takes you to work (whether or not it’s always on time is another story). It also serves as the backdrop to some of life’s biggest moments living in the Big Apple — or at least, it gets you to and from them.\nFor those reasons and more, several musicians have at some point paid tribute to the trains that fuel NYC in their music videos. One of them, Chappell Roan, named an entire song after the the mode of transport — 2025’s “The Subway” — naturally pairing it with a visual centered around the singer passing in and out of train cars while trekking around the city. Other musicians who’ve similarly featured the underground passages in their videos include modern stars such as Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter, as well as iconic figures of generations past like Michael Jackson and Rod Stewart.\nThough New Yorkers like to give the subways grief sometimes, most can probably agree that the city wouldn’t be what it is without them. See which artists have honored that legacy in their music videos below — and as always, stand clear of the closing doors, please.\n-\nAvril Lavigne, “My Happy Ending”\nYear: 2004\nLavigne filmed “My Happy Ending” in Brooklyn, featuring above-ground trains running in the background of some scenes.\n-\nBeastie Boys, “An Open Letter to NYC”\nYear: 2004\nIn their musical ode to NYC, the Beastie Boys subtly showcased the trains that power their home city by including shots of a train running and the underside of above-ground tracks for the “Open Letter to NYC” video.\n-\nChappell Roan, “The Subway”\nYear: 2025\nRoan filmed the subway car scenes for “The Subway” at the New York Transit Museum in Downtown Brooklyn.\n-\nJay-Z feat. Alicia Keys, “Empire State Of Mind”\nYear: 2009\nThe music video for Jay-Z and Alicia Keys’ iconic musical love letter to New York fittingly features a scene with the rapper sitting in front of a 1 train station in Harlem.\n-\nJennifer Lopez, “Feelin’ So Good”\nYear: 2000\nJenny From the Block catches a 6 train with her gal pals on a night out in the “Feelin’ So Good” visual — but even though she jumps over the turnstiles without paying the fare, others should only do so at their own risk.\n-\nLady Gaga, “LoveGame”\nYear: 2009\nAt the height of her early Fame, Gaga took a ride on the subway for her “LoveGame” video, flanked by backing dancers and with disco stick in hand. (Despite being shot to appear like the NYC subway system — the video begins with Times Square exteriors, and a sign for 42nd Street Station appears during one dance sequence the video actually was filmed in Los Angeles.)\n-\nMacy Gray, “I Try”\nYear: 1999\nWhat better place to yearn than on the subway? Macy Gray shows that a train ride is the perfect setting for some wistful thinking in “I Try.”\n-\nMichael Jackson, “Bad”\nYear: 1987\nAfter Jackson famously filmed his “Bad” music video at the Hoyt-Schermerhorn station in Brooklyn, Weird Al Yankovic did the same for his visual for “Fat,” his parody of MJ’s hit.\n-\nRod Stewart, “Downtown Train”\nYear: 1989\nStewart showcases a number of downtown-running trains in his “Downtown Train” video, including an R, a 6 and even an S, which is known for being the shortest subway line in NYC.\n-\nSabrina Carpenter, “Thumbs”\nYear: 2017\nCarpenter filmed the video for one of her early singles, “Thumbs,” on a set designed to look like a Brooklyn-bound 2 train.\n-\nTaylor Swift, “The Man”\nYear: 2020\nFrequent subway riders know all too well the character Swift embodies in “The Man” music video: someone who spreads their legs while sitting down, taking up way more than their allotted space on the coveted bench seats.\n-\nThe Avalanches, “Because I’m Me”\nYear: 2016\n“Because I’m Me” finds an impromptu concert and dance break erupting in a station on the B/D line — which isn’t totally unusual for NYC’s subway stations, where buskers often perform for commuters and tourists.",

      "content": "---\ntitle: Chappell Roan Rides ‘The Subway’ to First Post-Release Performance & Admits She’s ‘Really Nervous’ at Oslo Festival: 9 Best Moments\nauthor: Joe Lynch\nurl: https://www.billboard.com/lists/chappell-roan-oyafestival-oslo-best-moments/\nhostname: billboard.com\ndescription: Chappell Roan at Oyafestivalen in Oslo, Norway: The best moments.\nsitename: Billboard\ndate: 2025-08-06\ncategories: ['Pop']\ntags: ['festival, genre pop']\n---\nBefore Chappell Roan took the main stage at Øyafestivalen on Wednesday (Aug. 6) night in Norway, thousands of fans in fuzzy pink cowboy hats, chalky white face paint and a variety of looks from her music videos waited patiently on the tree-dotted lawn of Oslo’s gorgeous Tøyen Park.\nFrom a nearby stage, Australian punk band the Chats could be heard raging about everything from identify theft to the rising cost of smokes. For those unfamiliar with Roan’s live sets, the pre-show sonic bleed might have seemed like an incongruous juxtaposition, given that Roan is ostensibly a pop artist. But when she hit the stage for her Øyafestivalen debut, it quickly became clear that Roan and her all-female backing band can land a rock n’ roll punch just as well as a punk outfit (or any band that falls more obviously under the rock umbrella). The drums are hefty yet lean, thumping and energetic; the guitars crackle like fireworks and cut like buzzsaws; and Roan’s voice can give falsetto highs, growly lows and from-the-gut shrieks at a level above most pop stars.\nTwo years out from The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess and the runaway success of that LP and follow-up singles “Good Luck, Babe!” and “The Giver” (both Billboard Hot 100 top 10s), Roan is now on the Visions of Damsels and Other Dangerous Things Tour. The new stage design offers up an alternately whimsical and foreboding fairytale atmosphere, with red eyes peeping out from a stony gazebo, images of gargoyles flapping above church spires and an intricate art nouveau gate that looks like a castle one moment and a cemetery the next. It’s all fantastical camp, exactly the kind of heartfelt cosplay that has attracted LGBTQ people, allies and outside-the-box oddballs to Roan’s world, which is both refreshingly candid and playfully unserious, sometimes within the same song.\nHere are nine highlights from Chappell Roan at Øyafestivalen, from the first post-release performance of new single “The Subway” to a shout-out to her mom, who was in the crowd.\nBillboard’s travel and accommodations for Øyafestivalen were provided by Music Norway, which was founded by the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Culture and Equality.\n-\nThe Scream\nWearing a Lincoln green body suit with fairy wings, Roan ripped open the night with “Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl,” setting a high-energy, punchy tone. After spitting the “not overdramatic, I know what I want line,” Roan unleashed a glorious, guttural scream – and hey, Oslo is a pretty damn good city for a Scream.\n-\n‘Subway’ Fares Well, Despite a Bump\nRoan’s new single “The Subway” has been in her setlist previously, but Øyafestivalen is the first time she’s performed the song since it’s official release, a fact she noted in her introduction. “Did you watch the video yet?” she asked the crowd, which roared a collective affirmative. “If you haven’t, I encourage you to – it’s kinda good.” Now that it’s officially out, the crowd was able to sing along to every word (especially the line about moving the Saskatchewan), although it’s fresh enough that Roan flubbed one of the lyrics. Still, as a live pro, she was able to laugh it off and immediately return to her place in the song.\n-\nNothing Beats Heart\nWhen Roan guested on the After Dinner Thinks podcast, she told co-host Ann Wilson of Heart that “Barracuda” is “the coolest song ever,” one that makes her “feel like a rock star” while covering it. After debuting her Heart cover at Austin City Limits last year, she brought it to Øyafestivalen. There’s no doubting that it brings out a new side to her stage persona – ferocious, freewheeling and fun, giving her a moment away from highly personal material to unleash her inner ‘70s stadium rock queen.\n-\n‘Cherish’ Is the Word\n“Can you believe it? We’re in Oslo!” she shouted at one point, as much to her band as to herself. Later on in the show, she admitted, “I’m really nervous. I just haven’t done a show for a sec so I’m kinda nervous.” She also marveled at her songs traveling all the way to eager, receptive ears in Norway. “I’ve never been here before, it’s so beautiful,” she gushed. “This past year has been tough…. I’m so grateful you’re here. I needed this so bad when I was 15, 14. I just needed to feel free to dress up with other people who weren’t going to judge me for dressing up. Not only do I want you here, but I cherish you for who you are. You are cherished.”\n-\n‘Hot’ Hands\nIn the hands of her current band, “Hot to Go!” has a head-bobbing rock crunch on the verses, a nice edge that segues perfectly into the all-out, shout-along chorus. If Roan was a bit surprised by the fact that people in Norway know her music, she must have been knocked down by how ready the massive crowd was to deliver the “Hot to Go!” hand-ography. Despite the elbow-to-elbow throng near the stage, everyone somehow managed to do the motions without encroaching into other people’s personal space. (Hey, it’s a polite place.)\n-\n‘Giver’ Keeps on Giving Gold\nDuring her country-flavored “The Giver,” Roan has made a habit of reading out fan-solicited notes which explain how a romantic ex was in some way an insufficient giver, after which the whole audiences boos. Oslo got some doozies: “Daniel. He didn’t want to take off his Temu rings for me. F—k Temu and f—k Daniel. Adam: He stopped screwing me so he could play Fortnite. Jacob: He cheated on me twice in the same Burger King parking lot.” Burger King? Damn. Sometimes you really shouldn’t have it your way.\n-\nServing Security Realness\n“Who are the divas in the neon vests in the back?” Roan asked after dark had fallen on the festival grounds, pointing to some folks in the very back of her gargantuan crowd. She exploded into laughter when she realized “the divas” in question were serving 9-to-5 realness: “Oh, that’s security.”\n-\nA Dragon to Keep From Draggin’\nIn any artist’s live set, slower numbers can threaten to derail the energy a bit, or at least entice the audience to pop out and hit the bathroom or grab a drink. But Roan is clever when she brings out the ballads. Singing “Coffee,” she introduced us to her tour pet for this trek, a baby toy dragon (with its little eyes closed, aw) that she crooned to while seated on a throne. The song is a heart-wrencher, but when the camera pans in on a tiny toy dragon, you can’t help but giggle – it’s a smart way of adding levity to a serious song.\n-\nMaking Mama Proud\nOn closing number “Pink Pony Club,” everyone in the crowd – whether they were in a fluffy pink hat or not – was singing along, hanging on every word. After singing the lyric about her mother’s disdain over her daughter dancing in drag at a gay bar (“Won’t make my mama proud / it’s gonna cause a scene”), Roan had a bit of a revelation: her mother was in the crowd that night. When Roan hit that “God, what have you done?” wail on the pre-chorus, you can be sure everyone was singing extra loud, if only to let mama know that she should, in fact, be damn proud.",
