Roan has an uncommonly good ear: Unlike many of her contemporaries, she’s able to load her music with references without it ever feeling like she’s just slapping on her logo. Such is the case here—perhaps you can hear shades of Robin Guthrie’s skyward-soaring guitar, or Elizabeth Fraser and Dolores O’Riordan’s Celtic lilt, or Patch Hannan’s gentle rhythmic chug, but no single reference ever threatens to overwhelm.\nThat’s because, in just a few years, Roan has established herself as one of pop’s most distinctive writers. All the hallmarks of her style are here: the blunt nods to modernity (“I saw your green hair”); the frank sexuality (“Till I can break routine during foreplay”); the dryly theatrical humor (“I’m movin’ to Saskatchewan”). And, of course, an insistent, driving melody that reveals successive hooks with the fluidity and efficiency of synchronized swimmers. Roan’s real magic trick is in her ability to weaponize familiarity and novelty in such a way that a song like “The Subway” sounds totally fresh, even if it feels like you’ve been singing along with Roan’s cry that “she got away” for your whole life.",

Think of how the schmaltzy hook of “Pink Pony Club” accentuates its camp fantasia, or how the bravura vocal theatrics of “Good Luck, Babe!” make its narrator’s best wishes feel like a matter of life and death. At first, Roan’s new single “The Giver” appears far less weighty—a jaunty ditty about knowing you’re the only one who can really satisfy your lover—but it tells us more about her than almost any of its predecessors. “I can’t call myself the Midwest princess and not acknowledge country music,” Roan said in an interview on the Amazon Music Country Heat Weekly podcast. “That’s what’s around me in grocery stores. That’s what is playing on the bus.”\nAnd “The Giver” is unapologetically country, complete with banjo, rollicking fiddle leads, and barroom singalong “na-na-na”s. Roan cited Big & Rich’s “Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)” and Alan Jackson’s “Chattahoochee” as influences, but what I hear is Shania Twain—debuting the song on Saturday Night Live last year, Roan even offered her own take on the “This is what a woman wants” ad-lib from Twain’s 1995 single “Any Man of Mine” (this, sadly, didn’t make it into the studio version). A great country song uses a set of pre-established codes and signifiers in hopes of telling a new story, and “The Giver” proves Roan can do it handily. “Ain’t got antlers on my walls/But I sure know mating calls,” she sings over production from Dan Nigro that chugs like a train and revs like a pickup truck. “I can close my eyes/And have you wrapped around my fingers like that.” Don’t call it a crossover; just call it another genre conquered.",

Chappell Roan, daughter of Willard, Missouri, secured her ticket out through YouTube, where as a teenager she uploaded the cover songs that got her a major label deal before she finished high school. She started spending time in L.A. and recorded a series of dour, downtempo pop tunes. But Willard still had her in its grasp: In a promotional video from 2017, released around the same time as her first EP, Roan gazes mistily out a plane window and admits, “When I go back to L.A., I just don’t feel as grounded as I do when I’m home.”\nWhen her music lacked place and purpose, Roan found both at the Abbey. The storied West Hollywood gay bar inspired “Pink Pony Club,” a disco ball-dappled ode to escaping the suburbs for the California nightclubs. The song, released in 2020, effectively ended one chapter of Roan’s career: Her label, Atlantic, dropped her after its release. But it also pointed in a new direction. The “Pink Pony Club” is back open for business on The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, Roan’s full-length debut, a bold and uproarious pop project stitched with stories about discovering love, sex, and oneself in a new place. Marking her debut for Island Records, it’s buoyed by youthful vim and steely indifference to the bounds of good taste.\nMidwest Princess was written and produced with Dan Nigro, the onetime indie frontman who has recently gained prominence via his creative partnership with Olivia Rodrigo. As songwriters and performers, Rodrigo and Roan agree on a lot: Both are committedly theatrical and wickedly funny, even in the face of emotional indignity. “Casual,” Midwest Princess’s high point, lobs a cocktail of sorrow and scorn at a romantic partner who refuses to acknowledge the significance of their situationship. “Knee deep in the passenger seat and you’re eating me out/Is it casual now?” Roan deadpans in the chorus, cramming one of the record’s most vivid images into a single breath. The outro turns up the heat and raises the stakes: “I fucked you in the bathroom when we went to dinner/Your parents at the table, you wonder why I’m bitter?”\nRoan is blessed with a powerful and versatile voice, heard in full force on the blowout final line of “Casual.” On the otherwise unremarkable “After Midnight,” she floats some lovely whistle tones; on “Picture You,” she channels Patsy Cline, her voice warm and full-bodied, her phrasing immaculate. But, also like Rodrigo, she can be persuasive with less precise or tuneful deliveries. In the half-spoken, half-yelped bridge of the yeehaw booty call “Red Wine Supernova,” her comedic potential is maximized (“I heard you like magic?/I’ve got a wand and a rabbit!”). She zips through the verses of “Hot To Go!” with all the urgency of a spark burning through a fuse, then calls in the pep squad to spell-sing the title.",

Plus: Alvvays’ Molly Rankin reveals the song she wishes she wrote.\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2023-12-14\ncategories: ['features']\ntags: ['best of 2023']\n---\nOur weekly podcast includes in-depth analysis of the music we find extraordinary, exciting, and just plain terrible. This week, Editor-in-Chief Puja Patel, Reviews Director Jeremy D. Larson, and Associate Editor Cat Zhang discuss some of the trends, scandals, gossip, technological moves, and industry changes that shaped the musical landscape of 2023. They chat about the rampant influence of musical theater, the return of the dancer pop star, the recontextualization of the guitar, the rise of A.I. and the fall of the 1975’s Matthew Healy, and much, much more. Plus, stay tuned until the end, when Alvvays’ Molly Rankin talks to us about the one song she wishes she wrote.\nListen to this week’s episode and read an excerpt from it below. Follow The Pitchfork Review here, and check out all of Pitchfork’s 2023 wrap-up coverage here.\nJeremy D. Larson: Cat, you brought this idea called the Rise of the Musical Theater Girl. What is that?\nCat Zhang: Okay, there are a lot of big pop girls now who have musical theater backgrounds, or have that aura of theatricality to them. So we have Reneé Rapp, who is a Broadway star and in Mean Girls the musical, the movie. And then we have Olivia Rodrigo, who was in High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. And then we have Chappell Roan, who I think did musical theater growing up in school and has a cabaret aspect to her performance, both in her dress and then her singing style. And then we also have Caroline Polachek, who does have this sort of musical theater affect. A lot of it comes through in the vocalizations, just a willingness to push vocals over the top, to be a little catty, to be dramatic. And so, given that musical theater is historically perhaps disdained…\nLarson: There was a separation of church and state between musical theater and, you know, cool music.\nThe musical that most speaks to millennials, or Gen X, is Rent, right? And Rent was a rock musical. Rent was taking grunge and rock and turning it into, like, we're gonna put popular music on the stage. And I think now there’s some sort of a reversal, because there’s so many stars that come from the Disney engine, and the polarity has been reversed there. People are so familiar with musicals that that’s changing, like, how pop music sounds.\nZhang: I’m just thinking about the career of Sara Bareilles and where she is.\nLarson: I’m always thinking about the career of Sara Bareilles.\nZhang: And how she was first a pop star and now she has this crazy successful career on Broadway, but she hasn’t come back to the pop world, even though it is a big moment for girls with theater backgrounds in pop. So, Sara Bareilles, if you’re tuning in, come back.\nLarson: We haven’t even talked about the Sujan Stevens musical! And the Pavement musical. There were two indie musicals this year!\nZhang: Wow.\nLarson: Wow. Couldn’t have said it better myself.",
