Get the details.\nsitename: Billboard\ndate: 2024-05-31\ncategories: ['Chart Beat']\ntags: ['blues, Chart Beat, Music News, rock']\n---\nSlash Debuts at No. 1 on Blues Albums Chart With All-Star Collabs Set ‘Orgy of the Damned’\nThe effort boasts such guests as Gary Clark Jr., Beth Hart, AC/DC's Brian Johnson, Demi Lovato and Chris Stapleton.\nSlash charts new territory on Billboard’s rankings, as the guitarist’s new album, Orgy of the Damned, debuts at No. 1 on the Blues Albums chart (dated June 1). The new set, largely comprised of covers, is an all-star blues project, featuring guest vocalists including Gary Clark Jr., Beth Hart, AC/DC’s Brian Johnson, Demi Lovato, Iggy Pop and Chris Stapleton, among others. (It’s also Slash’s first entry on the Blues Albums tally.)\nOrgy is Slash’s first solo studio album since the rock icon’s 2010 self-titled set. Between the two solo endeavors, he’s released four studio sets featuring Myles Kennedy and The Conspirators.\nOrgy also launches in the top 10 on Billboard’s Top Album Sales, Vinyl Albums and Indie Store Album Sales charts, while also bowing in the top 20 on the Independent Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.\nThe Blues Albums chart ranks the top-selling blues titles of the week in the U.S., based on traditional album sales. Orgy sold 10,500 copies in the week ending May 23, according to Luminate. It marks the largest sales week for a blues album in a little over two years, since Bonnie Raitt’s Just Like That… launched at No. 1 on the May 7, 2022-dated list, with 14,000 sold in its first week.\nIn a press statement, Slash said, “I love blues music, but I haven’t really done the blues thing because I was always so busy with something else … [the album] was a very spontaneous thing. We just threw it together. There was no researching or trying to find the right tracks – these are just songs I like.”\nAmong the songs on the album: Robert Johnson’s “Crossroads” with Gary Clark Jr. on vocals and guitar, Willie Dixon’s “Hoochie Coochie Man” (made famous by Muddy Waters) with ZZ Top’s Billy F. Gibbons on vocals and guitar, and Peter Green’s “Oh Well” (first recorded by Fleetwood Mac) with Chris Stapleton on vocals.",

That song also featured some well-known names, including System of a Down‘s Serj Tankian and Black Sabbath’s Tony Iommi.\nThis time around, Guns N’ Roses are the source of the talent, with guitarist Slash and bassist Duff McKagan joining the project, which aims to raise money for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) via their Gibson Gives foundation.\nAccording to Rolling Stone, the lyrics for “I Can Breathe” were penned by McKagan, while Slash added “bluesy guitar licks”. Gueikian wrote the riffs and performed both rhythm guitar and keyboards, while Seta Von Gravessen took on bass duties and Jota Morelli played drums.\nTrending on Billboard\nThe final version of the track clocks in at just under six minutes, having apparently been halved from the original demo’s runtime of 12 minutes.\n“It was such a pleasure to work with Cesar and his whole crew on this tune,” McKagan said of the experience in a statement. “The musical slant and progressive rock-ness of this huge epic pushed me in a whole new direction.\n“I love a challenge and Cesar killed it! Most importantly, to be of service for mental health issues and awareness is super important to me at this time. Let’s rock!”\nAll proceeds of the track will be donated to NAMI, with a pair of auctions also launching alongside its release.\nThe first is a painting by Tankian titled “They’re Coming” which serves as the cover art for “I Can Breathe”. The other is a Les Paul Guitar which features Tankian’s artwork and the signatures of all involved. Both auctions can be found via Julien’s Auctions.",

The Guns N’ Roses guitarist and solo star wrote of his anguish over the loss of the artist alongside a moody picture of Knight staring into the camera.\n“My heart is permanently fractured. I will never ever stop missing you & remembering what a beacon of happiness, laughter, creativity & beauty you have always been. & still are,” Slash wrote. “The brightest light in the lives of so many that loved you so much. I find solace in the hope that you are at peace now. I will love you eternally. #LBK”\nOn July 22 Slash announced that Knight — the daughter of the guitarist’s longtime love Meegan Hodges and her ex, Mark Knight — had died. No information on the cause of death has been released so far, with the L.A. Medical Examiner’s office reportedly deferring the announcement as it completes additional testing. In his original post, Slash called Knight an “incredibly talented artist, a passionate dreamer, and a charming, lovable, sweet soul,” noting that she “passed away peacefully.”\nTrending on Billboard\nSlash’s latest tribute drew letters of support and condolence from some of his fellow musicians, including Lenny Kravitz, who wrote, “my deepest condolences brother. And yes, she still IS! Love to the family,” with Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello adding, “Ahh I’m so sorry my friend. Love to you and family.” Others offering kind words included former Megadeth bassist David Ellefson, skateboarder Christian Hosoi, former Headbangers Ball host Riki Rachtman, actor Jason Momoa and Fergie, among others.\nHours before announcing Knight’s death Slash announced the cancellation of four dates on his S.E.R.P.E.N.T. tour, “due to unforeseen circumstances.” As of Sunday (July 28), the traveling blues fest resumed with a show in Toronto and another coming up on Tuesday (July 30) in Lewiston, N.Y.\nCheck out Slash’s post below.",

      "content": "---\ntitle: Slash Recruits Iggy Pop, Steven Tyler & More For ‘Orgy of the Damned’: ‘I’m a Blues Guy’\nauthor: Gary Graff\nurl: https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/slash-interview-orgy-of-the-damned-blues-1235684144/\nhostname: billboard.com\ndescription: Slash returns to his youthful roots on the all-star blues album.\nsitename: Billboard\ndate: 2024-05-17\ncategories: ['Rock']\ntags: ['bbnews']\n---\nSlash has the blues these days. And he’s happy about it.\nOrgy of the Damned, the Guns N’ Roses guitarist’s new solo album (out Friday, May 17 on Gibson Records), is a set comprised mostly of blues covers and filled with A-list guests — Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler, ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons, Demi Lovato, Chris Stapleton, Gary Clark, Jr., Iggy Pop, the Black Crowes’ Chris Robinson and AC/DC’s Brian Johnson, to name a few.\nThe 12-track set takes the guitarist back to his youthful roots, touching on standards by Robert Johnson, Willie Dixon, Lightnin’ Hopkins, Howlin’ Wolf and others and also branching out into the psychedelic blues of Steppenwolf’s “The Pusher” and Motown favorites such as the Temptations’ “Papa Was a Rolling Stone” and Stevie Wonder’s “Living For the City.”\n“I’m a blues guy,” Slash tells Billboard via Zoom from his home base in Los Angeles. “That’s been the underpinning of my style ever since I picked up a guitar. But everybody knows me as a hard rock guy” — primarily from what he calls “more serous career choices” such as GNR, Velvet Revolver, Slash’s Snakepit and Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators. “So I’m not gonna about-face and go, ‘Oh, I’m a blues guy now and this is my serious blues record.’\nTrending on Billboard\n“But I’ve always thought, ‘God, it would be cool to do a record like this,’ sort of a just-for-fun kind of f***-around thing. But I never really had time to do something like that.”\nDuring the past couple of years, however, Slash says he’s “been listening to a lot of old blues record and blues guitar playing and I still wanted to do that kind of album. It’s just something fun that I really needed to get off my chest, and I wanted to have a good time with it.”\nSlash’s longtime manager Jeff Varner of Revelation Management adds that timing proved to be fortuitous for Orgy of the Damned as well as for the 29-date S.E.R.P.E.N.T. Blues Festival tour; Slash embarks July 5 in Bonner, Montana. “Prior to last year we were mapping out the next 24 months and this idea came up again,” Varner recalls. “He said, ‘I’m thinking about doing a blues record,’ and I said, ‘Funny, I’ve been thinking about doing that, making a tour property around it.’ It was a serendipitous moment of, ‘OK…’ Obviously he leads the charge, but we felt like there’s a real opportunity here and now’s a good time to do it.”\nFor the album, Slash recruited onetime GNR touring keyboardist Teddy Andreadis and bassist Johnny Griparic, who he played with in an ad hoc band called Slash’s Blues Ball during the late ’90s in Los Angeles. They added Michael Jerome on drums and started working on material with the idea of having fun at the top of the agenda.\n“I never wanted it to be taken too seriously and have it be this serious blues record like people are putting out these days,” explains Slash, whose sole original on Orgy of the Damned is the closing instrumental “Metal Chestnut.” “Most good musicians have a certain amount of integrity, so you take it seriously in that context but at the same time it was really just fun. I think that’s one of the reasons why the idea of having different singers was born, so as to keep it from being a ‘serious’ blues record.”\nIt’s not the first time Slash has taken the all-star approach, of course; his self-titled 2010 effort also featured a diverse roster of guest vocalists (Ozzy Osbourne, Dave Grohl and the Cult’s Ian Asbury to Fergie and Maroon 5’s Adam Levin). It also included Myles Kennedy and provided the impetus for the Conspirators band, which has released four studio albums. For Orgy of the Damned, Slash says he “picked the song first and just thought about who would sound good doing that song. The key thing for any of them was if the person I thought of related to the song and had any kind of history with it — if it meant something to them. That was the criteria for actually going forth and recording it.\n“Fortunately for pretty much everybody on the record, the song they’re on really had some deep meaning to them or they really loved it or it had an influence on them.”\nNowhere was that more true than on the acoustic rendering of Hopkin’s “Awful Dream” with Pop, who had also appeared on a track for the Slash album. “I read that Iggy had always wanted to do a blues record or project or whatever and I gave him a call,” Slash remembers. “I talked to him and he said that he’s never had the opportunity to do a blues thing. So I asked him, ‘If you were gonna do a blues song, which song would you do?’ and without missing a beat he said ‘Awful Dream,’ and there was something in the way he said it that sounded like it was really special to him.\n“We set up an appointment at the studio for the following week and he came down and we just sat on a couple of stools, facing each other, and played it a couple time straight through and I said, ‘That’s good enough.’ And he was great, man. It was really special to do it with him ’cause it felt like it was something he’d been wanting to do but never had a chance to do it. So that really opened it up to him.”\nThat’s just one of many magical music moments on Orgy of the Damned. Slash goes toe-to-toe with Clark Jr. on Robert Johnson’s “Crossroads” (closer to Cream’s reimagination than the original “Crossroad Blues”) and with Gibbons on Dixon’s “Hoochie Coochie Man.” AC/DC’s Johnson was Slash’s first choice for Howlin’ Wolf’s “Killing Floor,” and Tyler on harmonica was a bonus. “We were talking one day and I told him what we were doing and he offered to play harmonica on it — and came down that same day. It was a good hang.” Lovato’s appearance on “Papa Was a Rolling Stone” may surprise some, but not in the wake of the rock direction of her own recent music.\n“People don’t think of her in that capacity, but she’s absolutely amazing on it…and it’s cool to see her in a little bit of a different light,” manager Varner notes.\n“All the songs are songs I was influenced by from when I was really little, up until recently,” says Slash, who used the album to explore different aspects of his playing technique. “In the various bands I’ve been involved in there’s a lot of improvising and stuff that goes on but they’re bands with very defined songs and arrangements and stuff,” he explains. “I go out and jam a lot with different club bands that will let me sit in all over the country, if not all over the world, just ’cause I happen to be in the neighborhood, and you get to play with some really good players that have a nice, greasy feel. There’s something about that that you don’t get to do in the bands.\n“Even in doing the record, it was more laid back and you play from the heart and you don’t have the pressure of feeling like you’re trying to make sure you’re playing everything properly. It’s a lot looser and a lot more improv and laid back.”\nThe S.E.R.P.E.N.T. tour (Solidarity, Engagement, Restore, Peace, Equality N’ Tolerance) was a logical outgrowth of Orgy of the Damned, meanwhile. The trek will include a rotating cast of guests including the Warren Haynes Band, Samantha fish, Eric Gales, Keb’ Mo’, Robert Randolph, ZZ Ward, Christone “Kingfish” Ingram, Larkin Poe and Jackie Venson, and Slash predicts that “there’s gonna be any number of different jams going on” during the dates.\nSlash adds that he’s open to making more blues albums in the same manner as Orgy of the Damned, while Varner predicts that the S.E.R.P.E.N.T. tour could become a recurring theme in the future. “I think from our standpoint this is a fun project that’s pretty flexible and nimble,” he says. “I can definitely see doing more of the S.E.R.P.E.N.T. festival either here or in Europe, different versions of it. Our goal here is to create something that can be evergreen, something he can have as an additional outlet — not that he needs any more things on his plate.”\nThat’s a juggle Slash says he’s happy to maintain.\n“It’s just fun for me,” he says. “As a player that’s really what I enjoy doing. So having all these different sorts of opportunities to be able to play and record and to go out on the road, I really relish it. Just having this different variety of things to do is healthy. It’s very motivating for me, inspiring.”",

It was very tense. He had a gig in China the night before and then one in Thailand the night after. So it was like, ‘Slash is never going to be able to be here.’ He wasn’t at rehearsal.”\nAs viewers saw on Oscars night March 10, Slash did end up making it to the show. Behind the scenes, Gosling says he was relieved — but he didn’t even get the chance to debrief with the rock star after it was all over. “Suddenly, as I was walking into dress rehearsal, I saw a guitar case and it had a skull with a top hat on it,” he recalled. “And I knew that Slash had arrived. Then after the show, he was gone.”\n“I’m Just Ken” was one of five tracks nominated for best original song at this year’s Academy Awards, where another Barbie track, Billie Eilish and Finneas’ “What Was I Made For?,” ended up taking the prize. The sister-brother duo was the first to perform onstage at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, while Gosling, Slash, Mark Ronson and Co. served as the final performance.\nGosling’s next project post-Barbie is Fall Guy, which hits theaters Friday (May 3). He recently revealed his favorite Taylor Swift song in honor of his character in the film’s love for the pop star, as did costar Emily Blunt.\n“‘All Too Well’ right now has a real soft spot in my heart,” he told Fandango in April, while Blunt said, “‘Cruel Summer’ is pretty up there for me.”\nWatch Gosling’s full Jimmy Kimmel Live! interview below.",

It finds the country singer growling out the iconic lines, “I can’t help about the shape I’m in/ I can’t sing, I ain’t pretty and my legs are thin/ But don’t ask me what I think of you/ I might not give the answer that you want me to/ Oh well” over the top-hatted guitarist’s signature paint-peeling riffs.\nThe song has a long history of covers, including takes by everyone from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, to Kenny Wayne Shepherd, ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons, Haim, Aerosmith, Jason Isbell, Joe Jackson and the Eels, among many others.\nTrending on Billboard\n“So, this is the original Fleetwood Mac, which was founded by Peter Green, one of the greatest singer-songwriter-guitar players, he’s less known in the public, but very well known to us guitar players re the 60s British blues and he’s up there with Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Mick Taylor,” Slash said in a statement. “I remember hearing the song on the radio when I was probably 13, they used to play both the older version of Fleetwood Mac and the new version of the band with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham a lot. I always loved this song, and it’s a great guitar riff. I jammed it with the Blues Ball back in the ‘90s, and I’ve played it live here and there. I knew from the beginning I wanted to do the song on this record. It was also one of the songs that I was trying to figure out who would be the right vocalist for it, and one of the ideas I had was Chris Stapleton, who is one of the most brilliant singer songwriters today. He’s also got such a gritty and distinctive voice, so I called him up and he did an amazing job. I mean, his voice is so cool.”\nIt is the second single to date from Slash’s album, following on the heels of his previously released take on the blues standard “Killing Floor,” which features AC/DC singer Brian Johnson on vocals and Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler on harmonica.\nOrgy is described as an homage to Slash’s love of classic blues, with vocals from Gary Clark Jr., ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons, Dorothy, Iggy Pop, Paul Rodgers, Demi Lovato, Chris Robinson and Beth Hart. The house band supporting the guitarist on the record included two of his 1990s bandmates from Blues Ball, bassist Johnny Griparic and keyboardist Teddy ‘ZigZag’ Andreadis, as well as drummer Michael Jerome and singer/guitarist Tash Neal.\nThe album’s track list includes covers of songs by Robert Johnson, T. Bone Walker, Steppenwolf, Albert King, Stevie Wonder and Willie Dixon, among others. Stapleton is the musical guest on this weekend’s Saturday Night Live with host Ryan Gosling.\nSlash will take the songs on the road this summer with his S.E.R.P.E.N.T festival featuring the Warren Haynes Band, Keb’ ‘Mo, Christone “Kingfish” Ingram, Robert Randolph, Samantha Fish, Eric Gales, ZZ Ward, Jackie Venson, and Larkin Poe. The North American outing is slated to kick off on July 5 at the KettleHouse Amphitheater in Bonner, Montana.\nCheck out Slash’s preview and listen to the whole song below.",
