But on this summer’s intoxicating breakout hit, Sabrina Carpenter claims to be so irresistible that it pushes her lovers to the edge of insomnia. “Is it that sweet? I guess so,” she coos on “Espresso,” eyelash extensions fluttering innocently. “Say you can’t sleep, baby I know, that’s that me espresso.” Her allure is so piping hot that it melts grammar down into something deliciously dumb and maybe genius. Atop a breezy nu-disco beat, Carpenter delivers nonsensical, syntax-shredding lines—“Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya”…“I know I Mountain Dew it for ya”—with the “yoo-hoo” cheek of a Gen Z Betty Boop.\n“Espresso” and its even more successful follow-up single, “Please Please Please,” launched the 25-year-old Carpenter into a new echelon of pop stardom. It's been a long time coming. She spent her teenage years acting in a spin-off of the sitcom Boy Meets World and she released her first four records under the Disney umbrella. Like many before her, she eventually ditched the mouse ears to drop her first “big girl” album, 2022’s Emails I Can’t Send.\nSo here we are at Carpenter’s sixth album, Short n’ Sweet, a tee-hee title for a 36-minute album by a singer who stands just under five feet tall. In a pop landscape recently plagued by self-seriousness and a tiresome obsession with authenticity, Short n’ Sweet is a refreshing glass of escapism. Rest assured, Carpenter didn’t bunny hop over a vulnerable phase—Emails touched on a number of personal experiences including breakups, parental infidelity, and the fallout from a love triangle involving a certain “driver’s license.” But on Short n’ Sweet, Carpenter is here for a good time. As she establishes on the opening track, “Taste”: “Singin’ ’bout it don’t mean I care.”\nAcross 12 tracks, Carpenter plays with some familiar pop guises. There’s sparkly pop-rock (the semi-sapphic “Taste”), Dolly-indebted twang (“Slim Pickins,” “Sharpest Tool”), and at least one throwback R&B steamer (“Good Graces”). Though “Coincidence”’s singalong vibes step a little too close to the folk-pop campfire, Carpenter largely pulls off these stylistic crossovers thanks to a big-ass voice that she wields with ease. It also helps that she’s backed by a who’s-who of pop songwriters and producers. Short n’ Sweet’s primary co-writer is Amy Allen, who has many hits under her belt including four No. 1 songs this year. Other familiar names include Julia Michaels, One Direction mastermind John Ryan, and Ian Kirkpatrick. Jack Antonoff is here too—his sparkly synths are unmistakable on the dazzling “Please Please Please.”",

Larson’s review of the track.\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2024-04-29\ntags: ['music']\n---\nI know this came out almost three weeks ago, but it’s going to be 82 degrees in New York today and it’s fair to say that Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” is currently in pole position to be this year’s song of the summer. The luxury nu-disco tune’s got its hooks in me, and if you have a peripheral awareness of the phrases “That’s that me espresso” or “I’m working late/’Cause I’m a singer,” you’ll realize it has also wormed into the brains of thousands of others.\nThat’s part of what makes “Espresso” such a deliriously good pop song: It’s so unselfconsciously weird. What do you mean That’s that me espresso? Why are you saying I Mountain Dew it for ya? Oh, you’re working late because you’re a singer? That line is sung so matter-of-factly she turns it into some ancient cosmic truth about singers and the hours they keep. In this way “Espresso” recalls the ESL lingo of so many ’80s Italo-disco records, whose words evoke feeling more than denote meaning. But Carpenter also has a perfect turn of phrase with “Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya,” the kind of line that most pop writers will spend their careers trying to come up with.\nThe music—produced by Julian Bunetta, who helmed many One Direction songs—makes me think of a beefed up, sunny inverse of Carly Simon’s 1982 club hit “Why,” which featured disco legends Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of Chic on the track. “Espresso” moves with that same sense of reggae uplift, and we already know Carpenter knows her way around a Carly Simon tune. Pop’s disco revival is wearing a bit thin, but if you can do it with this much élan, this kind of cleverness, this singularly fizzy and bizarre vibe, maybe it can last just one more summer.",

Take a look at our favorites of the season, including “Whim Whamiee,” bops by Sabrina Carpenter and PinkPantheress, some egg-punk, and more.\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2025-08-06\ncategories: ['features']\n---\nIt’s August, which means the Song of the Summer debate has once again descended upon Pitchfork.com. And because it’s another year without a consensus favorite, here are 20 picks for Song of the Summer from our writers, scientifically parsed into three categories to provide the fullest picture of our annual discourse.\nThe Bonafide Contenders\nBad Bunny: “Nuevayol”\nLet’s be honest: Bad Bunny has claimed a song of the summer for most of the decade so far. But the radiant, speakers-cracking “NUEVAYoL,” from the Puerto Rican rapper’s hometown love letter DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, may just be his best. Looping in a sample from salsa legends El Gran Combo’s “Un Verano en Nueva York,” he unleashes an elastic, dembow floor-filler that seamlessly bridges past and present Boricua musical hallmarks. Here, Benito did better than just concoct an irresistible banger to quake out of every bodega and block party all summer; he rallied the Nuyorican diaspora for its new anthem.\n–Eric Torres\nPinkPantheress: “Illegal”\nOn “Illegal,” PinkPantheress’ sugariest hit to date, the singer/producer cleverly compares the time-warping headrush of getting overly fried to navigating a situationship at the height of its passion while staving off paranoia and overanalysis. A sticky haze of two-step drums and fizzing synth pads, the track is so blissed-out it’s just a little bit scary. When it all concludes in a sequence of shallow, rapid breaths, it’s equal parts erotic and erratic: The thrill of losing control becomes the whole appeal.\n–Jude Noel\nPLUTO & YKNIECE: “Whim Whamiee”\nThis is that fried glossolalia we need to unite the world in 2025 (WHIM WHAM!). The phrase hits like a roundhouse kick, five shots swigged at once, a maniacal grin after you clinch the jackpot (WHIM WHAMEEEE!). There’s an infectious arrogance to the song, these women so convinced of their own charisma, success, swagger (LULULEMON!). “We forever gettin' money, you forever gon' be mad,” Pluto cries as the drums do a little winner twerk in your loser ass face (AH-HA-HA!). Funkmaster Flex can keep hating (BOMB SOUND EFFECT) but I’m about to play this as much as “SkeeYee” (BOMB SOUND EFFECT MIXED WITH A GLORIOUS “WHIM WHAMIEEEEEE” SOARING OUT OF THE ASHES).\n–Kieran Press-Reynolds\nSabrina Carpenter: “Manchild”\nCan “Manchild” be a song of the summer if you really have to pay attention in order to fall in love with it? I thought this song was bad, but maybe I was just being, as Sabrina suggests, slow! A couple listens in, you start to appreciate its clever, playful misandry and really love Carpenter’s soft rhyme of “hard to get” with “incompetent.” Best of all, it sounds like K.K. Slider sitting in on a jam with Fleetwood Mac and ABBA circa “If It Wasn’t for the Nights.”\n–Shaad D’Souza\nSayuri & Sopholov / Fuentes Prod: “Secunena”\nPorn stars, infidelity, being a lifelong flirt: Sayuri & Sopholov tell all on their breakthrough single “Secunena,” a reggaeton howler that captures the delirious highs of the genre’s first wave. They sing lines like schoolyard chants, and with every repeated lyric the production amps up its cartoonish ambitions, serving up synthesized beats and melodies with cocksure flair. Producer Fuentes understands how to make every sound a noisemaker, but also a chance to feel the music in your body. Each summer needs a horned-up anthem this fun, this bawdy, that celebrates sex as an unruly romp.\n–Joshua Minsoo Kim\nJustin Bieber: “Daisies”\n“Daisies” is less a statement than a secret that Justin Bieber was waiting to whisper in our ear—surprising in both its sensibility and the sheer fact of its existence. Levity has hardly been a hallmark of modern-day Bieber, but this first single off his unexpected seventh album moves lightly as linen, with evident ease in its ambling beat and achingly simple, petal-plucking conceit. The man pulling the (guitar) strings here is Mk.gee, the anti-pop hero whose smudgy playing gives the song texture. From a pop star whose career has been defined by slick and “expensive-sounding sounds,” “Daisies” is proof that scaling back your ambition can yield sweet results.\n–Olivia Horn\nMOLIY: “Shake It to the Max (FLY) (Remix)” [ft. Silent Addy, Skillibeng & Shenseea]\nIt isn’t a New York summer without a dancehall hit. And, this year, “Shake It to the Max (FLY)” (the remix, specifically) is as ubiquitous in Flatbush as the aroma of jerk chicken and the sound of dollar cabs honking. It’s the song that wafts through the air as I bike down Church Ave., that Funkmaster Flex plays when he wants to switch it up from the government-mandated Kendrick, Drake, and Chris Brown. It’s all about MOLIY’s slinky, chipmunky shadow of a hook sandwiching cocky, snappy verses from Skillibeng and Shenseaa. It’s the real sound of a heat wave.\n–Mano Sundaresan\nAddison Rae: “Headphones On”\nIn the doldrums of summer, I often feel like a bug trapped in amber trying to claw my way towards a life worthy of the grandiose expectations that the season carries. The closest I’ve gotten to finding a sense of direction during these hot, neverending days has been the Zen musings of Addison Rae. Her song “Headphones On” is about accepting pain and discomfort as inexplicably tied to joy, about seeing the ordinary as sublime, about recognizing that any one moment in your life is as significant as another. Singing as gossamer as chiffon and as gently as a babbling stream, Rae reminds me that no one is coming to save me from my ennui, but that I can always take one small step—putting on my headphones and playing my favorite song—and make it my whole life.\n–Vrinda Jagota\nDrake / PARTYNEXTDOOR: “Somebody Loves Me”\nThis is what that Drake/PARTYNEXTDOOR album should’ve sounded like: two disgruntled men searching for love like Arthurian knights on their quest for the Holy Grail. If “NOKIA” was an easy layup to score a hit, “Somebody Loves Me” is a deep contested three that somehow goes in. It’s got the feel of an R&B demo, with PARTYNEXTDOOR and Drake skittering around a half-time beat doing impassioned Future Hendrix impressions. When they take turns singing that big, despondent hook—“Who’s out there for meeeeeeeee”—you can almost imagine them falling to their knees on the dancefloor.\n–Mano Sundaresan\nThe House Favorites\nZara Larsson: “Midnight Sun”\nIt wasn’t supposed to happen like this. I’d always kept Zara Larsson—10-year-old Swedish singing competition winner-turned-pop workhorse—safely sequestered in cell block six of the Khia Asylum. But “Midnight Sun” is simply too much my shit: Ray of Light via Jersey club by way of Lisa Frank, seemingly designed in a lab to short-circuit gay guys’ critical thinking. So try to believe me when I insist that there is subtle craft at work here, in the mixolydian arpeggios that undergird the song’s second verse, and the synth bass that flirts with Larsson’s (highly capable) voice as she sings, “It’s been a while since I cried over something so nice.” And by its final chorus, “Midnight Sun” gives up on syncopation entirely and begins jackhammering towards transcendence. Who needs subtlety anyway?\n–Walden Green\nBamby: “Pas Jalouse” [ft. Kerchak]\nShe rides a motorcycle and doesn’t need a man. He only came to the party to stir up trouble. But there’s one thing she can’t get off her mind: the way he looks underneath the ski mask he never takes off. She’s Bamby, the lightning-hot French Guianese singer whose collaborations with Martinique shatta queen Maureen and Amsterdam dancehall producer Kybba dominate my summer playlist. He’s Kerchak, the basso-voiced young French drill rapper recognizable by balaclava. And this is “Pas Jalouse,” a will-they-won’t-they dancefloor heat check with gothy orchestral ambiance and absolutely no right being this funny.\n–Anna Gaca\nLana Del Rey: “Henry, come on”\nFrustrated with what he saw was an inauthenticity in the way Americans were told to understand something so primal, the legendary boxing writer Jimmy Cannon once quipped that Howard Cosell was a guy who “changed his name, put on a toupee, and tried to convince the world that he tells it like it is.” But over the course of Lizzy Grant’s time as Lana Del Rey, her project—of using artifice as a lens onto spiritual truths—has only come to seem better suited for our world. On “Henry, come on,” the Christian God and Icarus and Levi Strauss and John Wayne (né Marion Robert Morrison) conspire to make the speaker feel at peace in her abandonment, alone in the West, motionless on the edge of a frontier.\n–Paul A. Thompson\nHaim: “Relationships”\nWhat’s summer without making a little mess? On “Relationships,” the melancholy high point of their new album, the Haim sisters try to figure out what’s not working: why happiness can feel so sad, who really started that fight, whether two people can ever truly work out their differences. Caught in a wistful groove that seems to skip and loop on end, they throw platitudes at the problem until it seems like everything is about to break down. Until, suddenly, things start blooming—the sturdy bassline picks back up; the piano flutters in gentle harmony; and, for a second, it seems like maybe this time it really will be easy.\n–Sam Goldner\nJorjiana: “Shark (Remix)” [ft. Babyfxce E & Chuckyy]\nI like to think I’d be shredding waves at the Rockaways every summer if I never heard John Williams’ Jaws theme. Fifty years on from the Spielberg hit, there’s a new frightening fish-inspired song: Jorjiana’s viral “Shark,” where the cartoonishly deadpan Indiana rapper terrorizes faceless bozos like they’re beachgoers in Martha’s Vineyard. With the kind of simple and repetitive hook that is sort of annoying until it inevitably gets stuck in your head, she gets spicy and reworks old Veeze flows over a minimalist beat that keeps the ominous Jaws vibe intact. Babyfxce E and Chuckyy match her energy with punchline-fueled verses that build up the tension until Jorjiana swings back for another round of “Shark, shark, shark, shark, shark, shark, shark a bitch.” It’s so goofy and irresistible that I bet even 93-year-old big John would dig it.\n–Alphonse Pierre\nLeft-Field Bangers\nEli Escobar: “i'll wait all day (4 U)”\nNew York DJ Eli Escobar’s “i’ll wait all day (4 U)” takes the architecture of the classic deep-in-the-feels club anthem and strips it to its essence: sunrise chords, a quick-stepping house rhythm, and a choppy, sped-up vocal hook that affixes itself to your heartstrings with a golden set of pliers. A bubbling synth arpeggio drifts and glistens, as bittersweet as a small, perfect thing behind glass. The effect is euphoric. “i’ll way all day (4 U)” is a song for falling in love on the dancefloor, for greeting the sunrise with a best friend, for coming out the other end of a long, hard slog and discovering that the secret to happiness lies inside yourself after all.\n–Philip Sherburne\nMedia Puzzle: “Bundy Vision”\nNothing quenches musical thirst in summer quite like back-to-basics pop, and Media Puzzle figured out how to morph their fidgety punk into a satisfying sugar rush. Abiding by the genre’s unspoken rules—less is more, sharpen the hook, at least one motto-ready lyric in the chorus—the Australian egg-punks are reclaiming pop songwriting from the grips of chart-chasers to make their own hit, “Bundy Vision.” From the carbonated bassline to the angelic vocal harmonies cut short, it’s got the right ingredients to go down easy.\n–Nina Corcoran\nSamba Jean-Baptiste: “born again freestyle (shed a tear).mp3”\nSamba Jean-Baptiste is an artist who conjures the feeling of flipping through tear-stained scrapbook pages. Most exemplary is his bare-bones, string-laden “born again freestyle,” a frigid track that’s followed me between rainy days and heatwaves this summer. Nestled somewhere between Kid Cudi’s earnest crooning and Dean Blunt’s dry thespianism, Jean-Baptiste beckons for his lover to stay in spite of himself. “A lot of good things come in weird packages, baby,” he sings, and I can picture that sheepish, give-me-one-more-chance kinda smile on his face. We’ve all been there, right?\n–Olivier Lafontant\nSmerz: “Feisty”\nStop, this is my soooooong! Like I’m the only girl in the wooooorld. OK OK, pee faster, pee faster, gotta get back out there!! Oh my God, no, of course, here, I’ll pass you some toilet paper. Ugh, did you see him out there too? I can’t believe we matched on Tinder, he’s so not my type. You think he’s flirting with me? Oh noooo—I mean, did you see his shoes? I guess that’s what they’re calling fashion these days. Ugh, is my eyeliner bleeding? Oh my God girl yes, of course you can borrow my lip gloss. Fuck, you look amazing! I love you, girl. You’re right, fuck him. Hey, what’s your name?\n–Arielle Gordon\ndexter in the newsagent: “Special”\nHave you ever been so in love that you start talking crazy? On the brisk “Special,” London’s dexter in the newsagent meets us there, in those moments when the summer sun kisses our crushes so gracefully that we’re ready to give it all away. She’s reserved yet assured as she makes big promises behind sweet guitar plucks: “I can love you like you want me to,” “I can give you all you want and more.” It’s a lot to offer, but it sounds so dreamy, the sort of love you want to root for.\n–Rae-Aila Crumble\nSickboyrari: “Can I gaal Yu”\nSummer is for flings, and also, in some cases, obsessively reinventing yourself in order to impress said flings. Just ask Sickboyrari, a lovelorn emo-rap legend who also answers to Black Kray, Gvcci Kray la Goth, 400 Dagree GothBwoi, Persian Cellphone Prince, and, a million other made-up monikers. Call it disingenuous, but there’s a certain honesty in customizing yourself, presenting as the person you would rather be. On “Can I gaal Yu,” he commits his most brazen act of shape-shifting yet—up-pitching, contorting, and layering his voice into a yearning squeak, like a small army of horny mice. The vocals might not sound human, but the desire certainly does.\n–Samuel Hyland",

This year’s edition featured pop giants like Chappell Roan, Charli XCX, and Sabrina Carpenter, but also indie vets like Waxahatchee, Beach House and LCD Soundsystem. Nocturnal revelers could catch the Dare or Brutalismus 3000, or DJ sets by Danny L Harle, Frost Children, or DJ Koze. There really was something for everyone—if only it was possible to see it all.\nThursday, June 5\nWhile the Mediterranean sun kissed the Primavera crowd, an intimate bunch gathered indoors in the pitch black confines of the 501 Club, transfixed by Barcelona experimental duo Dame Area. Producer Viktor Lux Crux and vocalist Silvia Konstance made the modest venue feel more like a guerilla punk show in a Berlin basement than a new festival stage. Awash in red light, Dame Area mostly played songs from their latest album, Toda la Verdad Sobre Dame Area, a bracing fusion of synth-punk, industrial, and the kind of dizzying polyrhythms you’d hear in Chicago footwork. When she wasn’t wailing on her drum pad in sync with Lux Crux, Konstance shouted and yelped into the mic, jerking her body back and forth to the beat. Dame Area’s savagely produced electronics make you feel like you’re inside of a machine that’s gone haywire, but Lux Crux and Konstance aren’t detached button-mashers; Konstance couldn’t keep from pogoing into the pit and communing with the crowd.\nAfter missing Coachella due to visa issues, FKA twigs triumphed at Primavera’s Estrella Damm stage on Thursday night, presiding over thousands of adoring fans. Her set was split into three acts, pulling heavily from her new album, Eusexua, while still fitting in tracks from Caprisongs and her heartbreak opera Magdalene. Aside from her agile voice and immaculate production, what really unites an FKA twigs performance are glorious expressions of the body. FKA twigs’ backup dancers—in glossy black tracksuits one moment and nearly nude the next—were so integral to the show that calling them “backup” feels insufficient. Their movements were muscular and staccato like military drills; they hung from metal scaffolding and gyrated, lifted twigs overhead like a ballerina, and swarmed her in fleshy flash mobs. At one point, twigs mounted a dancer like a pony, pretending to slap his ass as he crawled along the stage. And that’s what’s really at the core of an FKA twigs concert: the woman knows how to up the drama. She descended from a floating platform to open with “Perfect Stranger”; she swung around a stripper pole for “24hr Dog”; she brandished a katana sword during “Numbers,” a feat which culminated in the faux-stabbing of a dancer, kicking off his stomach to “dislodge” the blade. But perhaps the most staggering moment arrived in the final act, as twigs stood alone in a blood-red gown singing “Cellophane,” one of the most devastating breakup ballads of the past decade. twigs choked up just before each sweeping chorus, the muscles in her face fighting something back. When the cameras cut to the crowd, her fans were weeping for her.\nAs if anyone was unaware that Charli XCX was playing Primavera—for the second year in a row, I might add—there was plenty of sponsored and spontaneous content to warn you. Brat green ruled the festival grounds: short shorts, mesh shirts, official Charli merch, bootleg tees that read “Bratelona” or even “Turnstile” in that now ubiquitous color and font. And who could miss the Magnum ice cream bars (eh ehm, the “Bratnum” bar), with their slime green coating and edible logo? So yes, Charli’s presence was being beckoned from the opening bell of the fest, and when she took the stage after 1 a.m., the crowd was positively foaming at the mouth. But then… this is the Sweat Tour, Charli’s joint venture with Troye Sivan, who felt like a salt-free palate cleanser in between the juicy main courses, playing hits like My My My!,” “Bloom,” and “Rush.”\nEvery time Charli took the stage, she delivered a Grade-A blood transfusion, her charisma as a performer paralleled only by the sheer thrill of her songs, which included “Sympathy Is a Knife, “Guess,” and “Girl, So Confusing.” When she pranced around in a bra and panty set, belting “Von Dutch” and weaving through the crowd, it seemed at once like the candid performance of a teen singing into her hairbrush and the strut of a reigning diva. There were costume changes, of course, but none as memorable as the black baby tee with “PUTA” scrawled across the front, or plaid mini-skirt with panels streaming to the stage floor. As for accessories, nothing bested the brimming glass of white wine, which Charli proffered like your sloppiest aunt giving a wedding toast. “I’m drunk as fuck!” Charli belted at one point. That’s so brat.\nShuffling out with the dense crowd after Charli XCX and Troye Sivan, I was aiming for the exit when a gnarly beat pulled me in a different direction. It was Berlin-based electronic duo Brutalismus 3000, blasting through the speakers at the Amazon Music stage. Comprising producer Theo Zeitner and vocalist Victoria Vassiliki Daldas, Brutalismus 3000 play a roiling blend of hardstyle, gabber, and techno, dispatched with a punk sneer. Daldas, who sings in English, German, and Slovak, deploys a ragged sprechgesang that recalls both riot grrrl and the Prodigy. Dancing and moshing seemed equally appropriate as Zeitner fist pumped behind the decks and Daldas bounded around the stage in a white tracksuit, her black hair whipping around her face. As it neared 4 a.m., the crowd was slightly sloppy but dancing with full force. Brutalismus 3000 emit an aggressive lure, one from which I kept trying to slip away—I had been, by then, at the festival for 12 hours, after all—but each time I tried to leave, my body gave into the beat, and I wound up back among the sweaty hoards.\nFriday, June 6\nAmid all of the flashy production at a giant festival like Primavera, there’s something so refreshing about an indie group simply playing at its peak. Waxahatchee performed on the Cupra stage on Friday evening, with the Mediterranean Sea as their backdrop and diving seagulls as their dancers. Katie Crutchfield and her band breezed through songs from Tigers Blood, Saint Cloud, and Plains’ I Walked With You Always. MJ Lenderman, who played the same stage later that night, joined Waxahatchee for live renditions of “Right Back to It” and “Burns Out at Midnight.” Ahead of “Oxbow,” Crutchfield looked out into the crowd and said, “This song’s about Barcelona.” It was a poignant, full-circle moment: Crutchfield wrote the song in 2018, the last time Waxahatchee played Primavera. It was during that trip she decided to get sober. That clarity led to Saint Cloud. As she sang “I want it all” on repeat in the chorus, it felt like a wish fulfilled.\nThe Haim sisters are NEVER DATING AGAIN. Or, at least, that’s what their new album rollout suggests. Before hitting the Revolut stage, on Friday night, fragmented beats blared from the speakers, while a robotic female voice issued solemn vows: “I quit relationships.” “I quit my job.” “I quit dick.” All of this was accompanied by a red LED sign scrolling overhead, a setpiece that later served like an impish HAL 9000 for the sibling trio. After shredding through early tracks like “The Wire” and “My Song 5,” they dipped into newer material: Songs like “Relationships” were met with charged empathy from the ladies in the crowd, who gasped as the LED sign unfurled tales of cheating, money-grubbing men. “Fuck relationships! But just so you know, I’m still fucking single,” Danielle Haim shouted from center stage. Este chimed in with a supportive, if slightly off-brand addendum: “I love my fiance but fuck relationships!” Maybe the Haims aren’t really quitters—after all, their latest single is called “Take Me Back.”\nVictoria Legrand and Alex Scally might as well have been swept to the stage on an ocean gale; their set had a mythical quality, as the Beach House musicians played in a thick haze of fog and fuchsia light. The audience fell immediately into a trance, swaying and singing along to “Silver Soul,” “Drunk in LA,” and “Myth.” Legrand was obscured in a haze the entire set, but her voice cut through and put a spell on the entire crowd.\nThe pint-sized popstar had one of the lushest sets in all of Primavera (…except for Chappell Roan, but more on that later). Sabrina Carpenter’s performance was an homage to early Hollywood razzle-dazzle: Rogers-Astaire style dancers, sparkly ’fits, Carpenter occasionally perching on a white satin bed trimmed with fringe. Songs had their own kitschy infomercials; “Dial 1-800 Bed Chem,” one instructed. Another presented a “Manchild” repellant spray. And, of course, there was a sensual shot of café caliente ahead of “Espresso.” Sadly, there were a handful of sound issues throughout Carpenter’s set—but you wouldn’t know it from her performance. She hit all the notes, nailed every step in her choreo, and never stopped smiling. That’s what you get from a former Disney pro.\nSaturday, June 7\nIn the past six years, Dublin’s Fontaines D.C. have gone from Dublin upstarts to festival darlings, with their moody take on post-punk and ’90s alternative. Like the Britpop acts of 30 years ago, they they too have a bad-boy heartthrob at center stage; vocalist Grian Chatten, draped in a lime green jersey and baggy black trousers, has the melodic sense of a more austere Liam Gallagher, a less cheeky Damon Albarn. Fontaines D.C. opened with “Jackie Down the Line,” from 2022’s Skinty Fia, and continued with tracks from their most recent LP, Romance: “In the Modern World,” “Starburster,” and the title track. But the most memorable song was Skinty Fia ballad “I Love You,” which Chatten dedicated to Palestine. The text “Free Palestine” and “Israel is committing genocide. Use your voice” appeared on the jumbotron behind them in neon green, while Palestinian and Irish flags billowed above the audience. It was not only a plea for the safety of Gazans, but also an act of solidarity with Kneecap.\nChappell Roan fans were already infiltrating the audience long before the pop luminary began her 90-minute set on Saturday. You could plainly see them: the clusters of pink cowboy hats and assless chaps, the bubblegum balloons bobbing in the air, a pink flamingo pool floatie perched on someone’s shoulders. (I don’t think the “I like Chappell Roan and sucking cock” T-shirts were official merch, though.…) Roan made quite the entrance, on a stage projected with mythical imagery, a castle-like structure, and the occasional pyrotechnics. I’m not going to lie: it was kind of giving Wicked, but, in Roan’s rich visual lexicon, it all made sense. The superstar was decked out in a butterfly headdress and blue slit cape, which she eventually shed to reveal a bedazzled leotard. Every song Roan played—“Pink Pony Club,” “Good Luck, Babe!,” “The Giver,” the unreleased fan-fave “Subway,” to name a few—felt like the pop hit of the decade, a testament to Roan’s supreme songwriting talent and her dexterity as a live performer. Also: her band fucking shreds. Throughout all of Primavera, no artist had such a command over the crowd. Roan didn’t even have to give a cue to initiate a call-and-response on “Femininomenon” and “Hot to Go!” And who was doing the “H-O-T-T-O-G-O” dance from her VIP perch? Ms. Sabrina Carptener—along with every single person on the festival grounds.\nThe pink posse of Chappell Roan fans had mostly cleared out by the time LCD Soundsystem emerged at 1:30 in the morning, but the middle-aged men were happy to fill in. A sea of salt-and-pepper hair undulated to classics by the New York legends, who sounded sharp as ever. That nasty synth riff in “Dance Yrself Clean,” the Suicide-esque “Oh Baby,” the brusk “X-Ray Eyes.” But it wasn’t just Gen Xers and geriatric millennials dancing along: indie darlings MJ Lenderman and Water From Your Eyes’ Rachel Brown were up against the VIP barricade, swaying to classics “I Can Change” and “All My Friends.” Talk about timeless appeal.\nIt appears that Turnstile’s rabid fanbase extends all the way to Barcelona. The 3 a.m. set time was no deterrent for a packed crowd at the Amazon stage, who churned and moshed and crowd surfed and perched on shoulders to sing along. The Baltimore band banged out tracks from their new album, Never Enough, as well as their beloved 2021 breakout LP, Glow On. Lead singer Brendan Yates sprinted around the stage, leaping in the air and holding his arms in a “V” high above his head, as if delivering a sermon to his devout followers. But, much to the chagrin of many concertgoers, he seems to have kicked an old habit: He kept his shirt on the entire time.",
