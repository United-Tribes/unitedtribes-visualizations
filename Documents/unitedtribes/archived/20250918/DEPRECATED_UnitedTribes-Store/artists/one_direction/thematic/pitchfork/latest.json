If Liam Payne’s debut, released more than a decade after the band’s televised genesis, is any indication, Cowell was right. Payne is, at best, competent. His voice is pleasant but not especially charismatic. His choices are safe but uninspired. A couple of years after launching his career, his musical identity remains wholly unremarkable. (Cowell has since criticized Payne in the press for signing with Capitol, and not his own pop-pipeline label.) LP1’s 17 songs, including a 2018 Rita Ora collab from the 50 Shades Freed soundtrack and a Christmas number tacked on at the end, have the ambiance and trend-scraping of a Zara fitting room.\nThe journey from boy band to solo act has broken many aspiring pop stars. But what it requires most—gesturing at a distinct, compelling identity—is Payne’s biggest question mark. Despite being a UK tabloid fixture, he’s been unable to convey a discernible personality—or any personality at all. Even with a built-in global audience of millions, it’s unclear who this collection of middling songs could possibly resonate with. Former Directioners clamoring for a solo Liam album? New fans seeking nondescript, paint-by-numbers pop? And yet, improbably, Payne has been among the band’s most successful solo members, metrics-wise.\n“Strip That Down,” a 2017 love song premised on his freedom from One Direction and featuring a bloodless verse from Quavo, has amassed billions of plays. Other singles, like “Familiar,” with J Balvin and “Get Low,” with Zedd, despite being completely unmemorable, have proved adequate enough to satisfy the low bar of a generic pop playlist. Throwing spaghetti at a Spotify algorithm and seeing what sticks appears to be Payne’s strategy with the rest of LP1. The single “Stack It Up,” featuring A Boogie Wit da Hoodie, further betrays his ambition of an Ed Sheeran–style metabolism of the current pop sounds. There are layered R&B harmonies, vaguely Latin rhythms, and compressed synths as melody, but even with two songs written by Sheeran himself, Payne only gasps at his radio-ready effectiveness.\nIn recent press, Payne has hinted at the complexity of his life post–One Direction, including fatherhood, brushes with substance abuse, and frustration with accepting his role as the band’s most-boring member. But he draws little inspiration from that wealth of real-life experience. Instead, he relies on inane songwriting concepts, rote misogyny, and feelingless flexing. The lyrics are puerile and half-baked. It’s hardly worth laying them all out on the page, but the worst offender must be from (the nerve!) “Hips Don’t Lie”: “Don’t be giving me the eye/Unless you got what I need/I hope your hips don’t lie/Unless they’re lying with me,” he sings.\nOne song, “Both Ways,” takes the trope of hetero objectification of bisexual women to gross new lows: “No, no, I don’t discriminate/Bring it back to my place/Yeah, she like it both ways.” In addition to being offensive, it’s not even convincing as an expression of desire. If you can’t effectively use a pop song to communicate horniness, the most basic of human emotions, then what do you have? Listening to LP1, you almost feel sorry for Payne. It’s maybe more pathetic to have failed not for risking too much, but after seeming to have tried so little.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Some came from boy bands, others from reality TV—Geiger got her start on a show searching for a “new Partridge family”—but their music was much the same: exceedingly soft pop-rock that seemed made less for arenas than rom-coms or the soapy likes of “Laguna Beach.” (The video for Geiger’s biggest hit, “For You I Will (Confidence),” starred a then-A-list Kristin Cavallari.) It wasn’t a particularly remarkable run, nor did Geiger like it much—“I didn’t connect to what was happening on radio with singer-songwriter stuff at the time,” she told Rolling Stone—and after a couple sporadic forays into acting, she retired to pursue songwriting more to her own taste. Some of those songs would end up recorded by the 2010s’ crop of Ryan Cabreras, like One Direction, 5 Seconds of Summer, and, most notably, Canadian singer-songwriter Shawn Mendes, whose biggest hits (“Stitches,” “Treat You Better”) are Geiger-penned. LillyAnna, her debut as teddy<3 (It looked “cute,” she told Rolling Stone) is her coming out, both in the literal sense (Geiger came out as transgender last fall) and figuratively, as a solo artist of her own making.\nTeddy joins more and more of her peers who have been lured toward solo careers by the industry’s increasingly Darwinian royalty structure. Though singer-songwriters have won some victories lately in the battle to actually get paid, the “singer” part is still far more lucrative than “songwriter.” But songwriters looking to become lead artists face two pitfalls. The first is to treat solo albums as a sort of clearinghouse for rejected tracks. The other, counterintuitively, is to release an album full of would-be hits, the same finely wrought smashes they shop to superstars—except without the superstars. This rarely works out as well as they hope. No matter how undeniable the songs, they’re still haunted by the ghosts of other artists’ voices, when emerging artists need to establish their own.\nLillyAnna, named after an online alter-ego of Geiger’s, was written in the early 2010s. As a result, the album exists completely outside ’00s pop trends, which is part of its charm. The sun-kissed pop-rock of “Under the Blue” sounds a lot sweeter in 2018 than 2005, as do the lilting melody and “Here Comes the Sun” lifts of “Life Goes On,” or the VH1 scuzz of the title track. (They also, strangely, sound a thousand times better than anything Mendes has ever recorded.) Though the album was written pre-transition, Geiger wrote it from a place of searching—a “kind of all clouded” mental space, she said on Beats 1 Radio—and the subtext is noticeable and lends the album gravitas missing from the “Laguna Beach” days. The lyrics of “Under the Blue” fall like a warm hug. Geiger spits the verses of “I Was in a Cult” out with contempt, then roars the chorus like stomping on their ashes.",

It succeeded wildly on the first count, the second one not so much: on singles “Stay Useless” and “Fall In,” Steve Albini scoured the reverb and fuzz just to further expose Baldi’s facility with bittersweet melody. Baldi gives it another go on Here and Nowhere Else, enlisting John Congleton to wipe away any remnant of “Hey Cool Kid” and present Cloud Nothings as they’ve never been and probably never will be: a grisly, caustic punk trio knocking out harrowing and powerful singalongs in dingy basements that can barely contain the sound. Once again, though, Baldi is simply unwilling or unable to stop writing hook-filled songs, rendering Here and Nowhere Else even more tense and thrillingly conflicted than its predecessor.\nIn spite of the grayscale environs, Baldi would have you believe Here and Nowhere Else boasts a sunnier disposition than Attack on Memory, but the lyrics sheet is filled with brusque marching orders: a strangulated repetition of “Swallow” directing the listener through the desolate wilderness of “Giving Into Seeing”, and opener “Now Hear In” stating with cold equanimity, “I can feel your pain/And I feel alright about it.” The more noticeable shift Cloud Nothings make here is physical: They try to enact themselves into right thinking by ditching just about any verbal, mental, or instrumental unnecessary baggage.\nRegardless, Cloud Nothings have not gotten “tighter.” Baldi replaces the twinkly leads of the departed Joe Boyer by acting as both lead and rhythm guitarist, alternating low-slung, detuned riffs and shards of dissonance that owe equal debts to Josh Homme and J. Robbins. More than ever, Cloud Nothings are a band that will inspire novice guitarists to play along with their records, an important role for any band to occupy—and forget about the piano that occasionally popped up on the indulgent-by-comparison Attack on Memory: Despite Congleton’s C.V. (Bill Callahan, St. Vincent) the most ornate production trick featured here is an echo effect liquefying Baldi into a molten puddle during the phosphene-inducing coda of “Pattern Walks.” In fact, it’s pretty much the only production trick on Here and Nowhere Else, save for the frightening thwack of Jayson Gerycz’s snare coming off like a percussive Wilhelm scream.",

A week before the release of Channel Orange, the debut studio album that cemented his mainstream success, Frank Ocean traded liner notes for a Tumblr note. “4 summers ago, I met somebody. I was 19 years old. He was too,” he wrote, memorializing his first love in a now-immortal post.\nOcean’s two-paragraph message of thanks was largely received as a coming-out letter, and helped to formalize a significant relationship between Tumblr and music. He was one of the first popular queer musicians and celebrities who came of age, sexuality, and fame this decade on the microblogging site—folks like Troye Sivan, Halsey, Cara Delevigne, and Amandla Sternberg would also find fanbases there. For many young queer people and those otherwise culturally marginalized, Tumblr played home to communities where they became educated and politicized, to the point of their empowerment from cultural consumers to producers.\nFounded by David Karp in 2007, at a time when Don’t Ask Don’t Tell was still in effect and marriage equality felt like an impassable dream, Tumblr offered queer and nonconforming youths “an opaque space where users were less likely to be found and attacked,” says Allison McCracken, Associate Professor of American Studies at DePaul University and something of an expert on Tumblr-based youth subcultures. These same attributes—the heavily coded and highly visual way of communicating, the hard-to-parse archives, the mostly pseudonymous users—have made it difficult for the press and general audiences to fully grasp the platform’s impact on music and music fandom. “Tumblr has had a larger influence on English-speaking popular culture than most people realize,” says digital anthropologist Alex Cho, who’s written extensively about the site’s queer POC users. More than any other digital space, it helped to queer an entire generation.\nIn 2019, pop is beginning to look like everything Tumblr wanted it to be in the early 2010s: inclusive, empowered, and increasingly gay. Many artists are out and proud about their nuanced queer identities, from Kehlani to Janelle Monáe, while non-queer artists are making sure to bring in, and sometimes pander to, highly engaged queer audiences. Even Taylor Swift, newfound queen of Tumblr aesthetics, has built the practice of “queerbaiting” into her release strategy. Hints of homoeroticism have become as common among pop stars—from Ariana Grande to Dua Lipa to Charli XCX—as they are characters on a teen soap.\nThe new language used to articulate gender and sexual identity has been popularized in lockstep with the platform. “The site’s queer users have led the way for the mainstream proliferation of queer/gender-conforming identity development,” McCracken says. Asexuality, demisexuality, grey sexuality, pansexuality, as well as non-binary—which may have even originated as a term on the site, it’s difficult to tell—have made their way, as public labels, to the pop world. Miley Cyrus, Kesha, Sia, Monáe, and others have identified themselves as at least one of the above, in the time since Tumblr popularized these micro-minorities in the early 2010s. “This is the Tumblr effect,” McCracken adds.\nThe sheer desire for queer representation that overwhelmed Tumblr fandom in the mid-2010s is now so common in the mainstream that a new type of celebrity has emerged, one whose queer identity is as celebrated as their art. Consider Troye Sivan, who has been praised for bringing bottoming to pop via his song “Bloom”; or Hayley Kiyoko, the former Disney Channel star who affirmed that “girls like girls just like boys do” in her breakout hit; or Shura, the British singer-songwriter who remodeled Rodin’s iconic sculpture “The Kiss” to feature two women on her album cover. Each of these budding icons has been sloganized accordingly: Sivan is the Gay Prince of Pop, Kiyoko is the Lesbian Jesus, and Shura is the Lesbian Pope. These artists and others, like King Princess and MNEK, are often marketed and editorialized based on their queerness alone.\nWith the rise of queer acceptance came the monetization of it. Meme librarian Amanda Brennan, who works on Tumblr’s Fandometrics project to chart fan trends across the site, says she noticed a large spike in popularity for Panic! At The Disco among Tumblr users when the band’s singer Brendon Urie began identifying as pansexual in July 2018. The same happened for Lil Nas X when he revealed this summer that he isn’t straight. In a formative example of this trend, back in 2015, Kiyoko found her music career bolstered by queer Tumblr fandom after releasing “Girls Like Girls.” While she’d already accrued a small following thanks to her role in Wizards of Waverly Place, Kiyoko’s popularity grew exponentially after Tumblr caught wind of her ode to other girls. “I watched Hayley Kiyoko’s 5 minuet [sic] music video about two girls,” one user posted, after seeing their desires refracted into ceaseless GIF form for perhaps the first time. “It had me on the edge of tears, and it makes me so upset b/c to me finding content like that 5 minuet [sic] video is so rare.”\nThat image-based ephemera is part of what makes Tumblr resonate with such immediacy. Users’ dashboards are filled mostly with visual mediums—GIFs, photos, screenshots, and videos, all capable of evoking strong feelings. People can share their desires not just with the clumsiness of words, but with the impossible romance of a highly edited image, an endless loop of two people kissing. For musicians who came of art and age on the website, the music become inseparable from its same-sex, pastel-colored imagery: the orange of Ocean’s summer of love, the pink-aquamarine of Halsey’s Badlands, the candy-floss backdrop of Troye Sivan’s Blue Neighourhood. At this point, these album covers might be described as giving off “Tumblr vibes,” Brennan says, i.e. “dreamy and thoughtful and super, super queer.”\nThis doesn’t mean the artist has to actually be queer, though. Brennan points to Taylor Swift’s use of “Tumblr vibes” on her new album Lover, whose cover resembles the kind of fan art you’d find on the platform, all butterflies and millennial pink. She sees some of the trends found within Tumblr’s LGBT+ tags—“positivity, self-empowerment, vivid colors”—reflected within the visual world of Swift’s seventh album. This itself is not so surprising: In addition to courting a queer audience with her rainbow-colored, LGBTQ-icon-featuring video for “You Need to Calm Down,” Swift’s most active social media presence is on Tumblr, where she regularly interacts with fans, often reblogging their praise and referring to them by their first names.\nThe intense level of engagement that Tumblr inspires from its queer users is an especially valuable currency now that most musicians make more money from their tours and merchandise than their actual music. At the same time as this industry-wide shift, says McCracken, “the last 10 years has really seen what is considered by fan studies scholars as the mainstreaming of fandom by the corporate media.” That’s also meant that queer fans, who rely on “transformative works” (fan-created and fan-centered art) in order to serve their own interests, have been targeted more directly. Queer people will find themselves represented (or appropriated) in pop music now more than ever—they’re even beginning to share a common language. “‘Cause shade never made anybody less gay,” sings Swift, who recently came out as straight, on “You Need To Calm Down.”\nIt’s now increasingly common for queer fans on Tumblr to bolster the popularity of musicians who are thought to be heterosexual. This is the case for Charli XCX, once a very active Tumblr user herself. In return, she often echoes the language of her queer fanbase, rooting for herself via the excessively punctuated enthusiasm and multiple letter cases of a Tumblr post (“i really feel like Gone is one of the best songs that has been released this year.... like it’s in the top 10 best songs of the year FOR SURE. right?!? rt if u agree,” she recently tweeted). This is also, bewilderingly, the case for Hozier. The Irish “Take Me to Church” singer espouses a particularly sapphic kind of yearning, according to his queer fanbase on Tumblr. “Hozier is a lesbian” is currently an active tag on the site.\nThere’s no greater example of the campy veneration of heterosexual artists on Tumblr than One Direction. This was largely thanks to Rainbow Direction, a campaign for queer visibility among 1D fans, created in 2013 by a Tumblr user who was tired of seeing straight girls targeted exclusively by the band. As 1D members became aware of their popularity on the site, they often participated in Tumblr fan Q&As, where they interacted with a largely queer fanbase that helped keep them at the forefront of culture until their split. “It’s a great example of how Tumblr fans queered popular culture,” McCracken says. “On Tumblr, lesbian fans of One Direction were so pervasive that they defined the fandom there.” Those attending One Direction shows were encouraged to wear rainbow clothing and accessories, which likely resulted in Harry Styles waving a rainbow Pride flag in September 2015. In the years since, the androgynous Styles has cultivated a kind of queer appeal, particularly after staying ambiguous about his own sexuality and debuting songs with a perceived subtext of bisexuality.\nNow, nearly a half-decade removed from the height of Rainbow Direction, it’s hard not to feel nostalgic for the Tumblr we once knew—where queer earnestness was encouraged, where Frank Ocean felt safe enough to share his heart. Since Verizon’s acquisition of Tumblr in 2017, once highly active users of the site began to feel disaffected. That was exacerbated when the company decided to purge Tumblr’s archives of pornographic content in 2018, effectively putting a digital chastity belt on its queer users who once looked to the site for a horny representation of themselves. In the early 2010s, Tumblr was a construction site for new ways of identifying beyond the heteropatriarchal binary. Today, these values have been co-opted and sanitized for the purpose of profit. At the very least, like Frank, we’ll always have the memories.",
