And again. And again.\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2023-04-27\ncategories: ['features']\n---\nLast summer, a smirking, red-headed rapper and University of Wisconsin marketing graduate calling himself Yung Gravy scored a breakout hit by way of a karaoke staple that also happens to be one of the internet’s oldest jokes. “Betty (Get Money)” is built around a repurposed hook of Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” and lazily riffs on the meme-ish practice of Rickrolling. It’s hardly the only recent example of a Top 40 hit refashioning the catchiest parts of a previous Top 40 hit, but it is a particularly egregious version of the trend—one that underscores a sea change in how the music industry capitalizes on its own ready-made nostalgia.\nThere is a single person who’s arguably most responsible for the existence of “Betty (Get Money).” It’s not Yung Gravy or his producers or anyone at his label. Not Astley or even “Never Gonna Give You Up” songwriter Pete Waterman. It’s Justin Shukat, the president of the music publishing company Primary Wave.\nAfter clocking the 1987 smash’s internet infamy, Primary Wave acquired a percentage of the rights to it from Waterman and then pitched the idea of an interpolation to Yung Gravy’s manager. At the same time, a member of Shukat’s team reached out to a producer who worked with Gravy. “Within a day, we literally had a track to listen to, and Gravy rapped over it two days later, which was fucking dope,” Shukat says over the phone. He was less enthused by the original track’s name—“Get Pussy”—and requested a rework, which was obliged. The song went on to peak at No. 30 on the Hot 100 and currently has more than 200 million plays on Spotify. When I observe that Shukat is describing a role more akin to a music producer than a publisher, he says, “I’m comfortable with that. We’re producing on a daily basis.”\nOnce upon a time, music publishing was a profoundly unsexy profession, the IRS of the industry. When a sample or interpolation needed clearing, some ink-stained wretch from one of the major publishers would amble out to furnish the papers and disappear back into the Xerox mines. Today, music publishers are the ones making headlines. Industry power brokers like L.A. Reid and Clive Davis have largely been supplanted by figures like Primary Wave CEO Larry Mestel or Merck Mercuriadis, president of the venture-capitalist upstart Hipgnosis Songs Fund. The jaw-dropping transactions—Bob Dylan to Universal’s publishing arm for somewhere north of $300 million; half of Neil Young’s catalog to Hipgnosis for $150 million; Stevie Nicks to Primary Wave for close to $100 million—come not from artist signings but catalog acquisitions.\nIn the current speculative boom, Primary Wave enjoys a 15-year head start. The founders—Mestel, along with Shukat and Adam Lowenberg—met at Arista Records in the late 1990s, when the industry was breaking all-time revenue records. In 2005, when the CD boom started to go bust amid widespread piracy, Mestel left Arista to found Primary Wave, inviting Shukat and Lowenberg to join him. In March of 2006, Primary Wave announced its first-ever acquisition: the catalog of Kurt Cobain, for which it shelled out $50 million.\nSince then, they’ve been consistently ahead of the curve, acquiring the rights to music by Bob Marley, Smokey Robinson, Prince, Stevie Nicks, James Brown, and Whitney Houston, and testing the boundaries of what a modern publishing house could get done. Lowenberg fondly recounts an Aerosmith-themed lottery campaign from 2009, in which scratch-off tickets revealed the lyrics to the band’s 1973 power ballad “Dream On.” The project raked in royalties on both the publishing side, because of the printed lyrics on the tickets themselves, and for the master recording, since the radio and TV spots publicizing the jackpot played the song on-air. The multimillion-dollar deal was designed with Aerosmith’s home state of Massachusetts in mind, but ended up spreading to 10 states. “Once we executed that,” Lowenberg says, “we were like, ‘OK, we can do anything.’”\nLowenberg notes that his position at Primary Wave—chief of marketing—hardly exists at other publishing houses, and he describes their work as “artist re-development.” His team assembles three-to-five-year marketing plans for each new acquisition, and then presents a pitch deck to the artist or their estate. In 2016, they presented a skeptical Smokey Robinson with the idea of a national holiday centered around the Temptations’ 1964 classic “My Girl,” which Robinson co-wrote. “He looked at us like we were crazy,” Lowenberg remembers. “We just asked him, ‘Do you like the idea? Because if you do, challenge accepted.’” Robinson announced the first-ever “Father-Daughter Day” on October 8, 2017, along with lullaby renditions of “My Girl.”\nIn nearly every respect, Primary Wave treats their catalogs the way powerful record labels treat their star artists—except all of the publishing company’s talent is either dead, a legend, or both. And when you own the rights to some of the most important American popular music ever recorded, opportunities have a way of presenting themselves in perpetuity.\nAlong with their aggressive pursuit of renewed hits, Primary Wave is also exploring novel ways to capitalize on their holdings. Last year, they acquired James Brown’s estate, which includes the deed to Brown’s childhood home—music publishing as real estate. “How do we turn James Brown’s house into a mini-Graceland?” Lowenberg wonders aloud. “Do we launch it first, you know, in the metaverse, and have people able to walk through and learn about James Brown’s house?”\nIn the past few years, Primary Wave has been joined by what Shukat estimates are more than 20 similar companies. He points directly to the pandemic as the cause for the catalog stampede, which erased touring income from everyone’s ledger sheets for nearly two years. Now it feels like a week doesn’t go by without a major artist’s catalog getting scooped up.\nHipgnosis CEO Merck Mercuriadis is another self-styled disruptor in the field—so much so that he refuses the label “music publishing” entirely, deeming Hipgnosis a “song management company.” “I view these iconic songs as the energy that makes the world go around,” Mercuriadis says, “and they need to be managed with the same responsibility as you would expect to manage a person.” Speaking to me over his car stereo as he makes his way from his Hollywood Hills home to his flight to Coachella, he adds that the majority of Hipgnosis employees are former artist managers. He is eager to mention how each person works on less than 1,000 songs at a time, sounding like a private-school principal touting their exceptionally low teacher-to-student ratio.\nLike the top brass at Primary Wave, Mercuriadis is an old lion of the music industry—he can speak fondly and authentically of his time managing high-powered clients like Elton John, Guns N’ Roses, Morrissey, Mariah Carey, and Beyoncé. He still represents the legendary songwriter and producer Nile Rodgers, with whom he founded Hipgnosis in 2018. Speaking about his contributions to the music world, Mercuriadis breaks out a classic bit of CEO humility: “What I brought to the table to my clients as a manager was responsibility: I can’t play the guitar, I can’t sing a song, but I can play the iPhone better than Jimmy Page can play a Les Paul.”\nHe cites the company’s treatment of Rick James’ catalog—specifically “Super Freak,” which hit No. 16 on the Hot 100 in 1981—as an exemplar of their approach. “We knew there would be a demand, if we put it out there, for Rick’s songs to be interpolated and sampled,” he says. “You don’t need to look beyond ‘U Can’t Touch This’ to see how a Top 20 single then becomes a global No. 1 single.”\nAnd, in fact, the Hipgnosis team did not look beyond that ubiquitous MC Hammer hit from 1990. When they farmed Rick James instrumentals out to numerous producers and artist teams, looking for viable hits to capitalize on their catalog ownership, they seized on a barely tweaked rework of the same “Super Freak” sample featured in “U Can’t Touch This,” from a producer named Malibu Babie, which they then sent to Nicki Minaj. The superstar brought the track to a songwriting team, including the disgraced producer Dr. Luke, to craft “Super Freaky Girl,” which became her first No. 1 hit as an unaccompanied artist last year.\nMercuriadis points to “Super Freaky Girl” as proof of concept for Hipgnosis’ mission statement. “You look back on the legacy of ‘Super Freak,’ and it’s been a hit three times over,” he says. His command of pop-cultural history is undeniable—he is the rare CEO as eager to expound on Rick James’ foundational influence on the sound of hip-hop as he is to name his favorite Neil Young deep cut (“Vampire Blues”). But as Mercuriadis waxes poetic about the way in which songs “become a part of the fabric of our lives,” it’s difficult not to notice that we are, in fact, talking only of the songs he owns.\nThe rise in catalog acquisition helps to explain how we’ve arrived at a moment when the pop charts are littered with chunks of old intellectual property. Nicki’s “Super Freaky Girl” and Yung Gravy’s “Betty” are just two high-profile examples; you don’t have to look far for more. The Santa Clara, California rapper Saweetie’s “P.U.S.S.Y. (Powerful, Utopia, Supreme, Sacred, Yummy)” samples Mtume’s “Juicy Fruit,” the basis for Biggie’s “Juicy.” Atlanta’s Latto double-dipped Tom Tom Club’s “Genius of Love,” famously sampled on Mariah Carey’s “Fantasy,” for her song “Big Energy,” bringing in Mariah herself for bonus points. Samples don’t even need to be universally regarded classics to break through, a point Jack Harlow proved when he reused Fergie’s “Glamorous” for “First Class.”\nThe echoes have grown so constant that self-described music theorists have found fruitful sidelines in doing side-by-side comparisons of the plagiarism charge of the day, game-show style. Lil Nas X’s “That’s What I Want” contains a sly nod towards OutKast’s “Hey Ya” that almost seems like a dare to copyright lawyers or red meat tossed to TikTok detectives; typing the words “Lil Nas X Hey Ya” into Google unleashes a hurricane of conjecture, as well as citations by The Guardian and L.A. Times. Pop-star fashion plate Harry Styles’ “As It Was” so nakedly recalls a-ha’s “Take On Me” that fans did mash-ups of the two tracks, and Genius even lists “Take On Me” as a “sample” on “As It Was,” though it isn’t technically credited in the proper liner notes.\nPeering at the pop charts with this mindset, every song becomes a potential whodunnit, rife with potential red herrings. When the brash British pop singer Raye sings “I don’t wanna feel how I did last night” on “Escapism,” is that an intentional reference to a certain Red Hot Chili Peppers classic? In some ways, the Hot 100 right now feels as recursive, all-encompassing, and allergic to new input as the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nPerhaps some of this recursion is a reflection of a changing guard. Gen Z grew up with even more media at their fingertips than previous generations, and a cohort for whom TikTok is the dominant medium might have fewer hang-ups about repurposing looks and ideas wholesale. But just as with the MCU, once you tune out the parade of surface nostalgia, it’s easy to hear the massive engines of corporate consolidation whirring beneath, and they’re being fed by companies like Primary Wave and Hipgnosis.\nTikTok content\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nPerhaps ironically, the boom in familiar samples also comes at a time of unprecedented litigiousness in the music industry. Ever since the Marvin Gaye Estate prevailed in their court battle against Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke over the similarities between their 2013 hit “Blurred Lines” and Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up,” labels and songwriting teams have made it a practice to analyze their songs for potential legally thorny resemblances. Under the precedent set by that case, even vague rhythmic and melodic commonalities could lead to a costly infringement battle.\nAt Primary Wave, Shukat fields near-constant phone calls from wary attorneys seeking to sidestep litigation. He points to Maroon 5’s 2019 single “Memories,” explaining how an attorney for the band’s label reached out to Primary Wave in advance because they had concluded the track was a little too close to Bob Marley’s “No Woman, No Cry” for comfort. Shukat adds that Primary Wave declined to ask for too big a percentage of the Maroon 5 hit, as a matter of courtesy. “We could have been a pig and asked for more, but they called ahead, they were being thoughtful. At the end of the day, it was a monster hit, and we own a big piece of that song.”\nShukat is constantly on the lookout for opportunities like this. Sometimes, they fall in his lap, as when Atlanta rapper Baby Tate’s 2016 song “Hey, Mickey!” unexpectedly went viral on TikTok earlier this year. The song was built on an uncleared sample of Toni Basil’s 1981 camp classic, which Primary also owns, but instead of swooping in with a cease-and-desist, Shukat reached out to Baby Tate’s team to work out the rights and royalties. “We’ll have a large portion of that song going forward,” Shukat says, “and I wanna go out and support it the best we can.” He immediately invited the young rapper to perform at a Primary Wave-sponsored event in Los Angeles.\nThese kinds of preemptive arrangements have become standard practice. Olivia Rodrigo made headlines in 2021 in part because her team extended co-writing credits to Paramore for one song (“Good 4 U”) and to Taylor Swift for two others (“Deja Vu” and “1 Step Forward, Three Steps Back”) based largely on chord progressions and vague resemblances. Even with all these precautions, legal complications loom. Despite owning a chunk of the publishing for Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up,” Primary Wave still found itself embroiled in legal proceedings over “Betty (Get Money).” Astley filed a lawsuit against Yung Gravy, alleging that he and his collaborators “conspired to include a deliberate and nearly indistinguishable imitation of Mr. Astley’s voice” in order to fool listeners into believing it was “actually Mr. Astley singing and/or a direct sample.” For his lawsuit, which has yet to be resolved, Astley hired the same lawyer that represented the Marvin Gaye Estate in the “Blurred Lines” trial.\nThe songwriter Nija Charles, who has worked with pop stars like Cardi B, SZA, Kehlani, Megan Thee Stallion, and Beyoncé, says she’s seen the ever-present fear of litigation chill the songwriting landscape. “Everyone is scared,” Charles says. “There are only 12 notes in music, and probably once a week we stumble on something that we’ve possibly recreated and we haven’t even realized it.” Charles says that whenever something she writes sounds familiar, she’ll end up changing it, even if she can’t place the exact source, to be safe. When I ask for examples, she confesses she can’t pinpoint one “because it literally happens all the time.”\nCharles worked on Beyoncé’s Renaissance, a sample-rich masterwork that split the difference between homage and interpretation at every available opportunity. As arguably the planet’s most powerful pop star, Beyoncé works with huge, recognizable slices of IP; unlike most, she is able to keep an army of lawyers and consultants on hand to iron out details and liaise with publishers in order to arrive at mutually beneficial arrangements. When Charles first heard the music for Renaissance’s “Cozy,” the overlapping house samples of Lidell Townsell’s “Get With You” and Danube Dance’s “Unique,” as well as the snippets from TS Madison’s YouTube video “Bitch I’m Black,” were already present and cleared: all she had to do was write to it.\nBut even Team Beyoncé isn’t bulletproof: “It’s not a collab it’s theft,” Kelis said tartly last summer, referring to the “Milkshake” interpolation that originally appeared on Renaissance’s “Energy.” (In response, Beyoncé’s team swiftly removed that bit from the album and updated it across all streaming platforms.) The pop music landscape is starting to resemble a cross between gold rush and minefield: You might turn up a gold hunk that will enrich you beyond your wildest dreams—or you might be blown to pieces.\nThe only common link in all this furious, often contradictory activity is the rank scent of desperation. The copyright squabbles, the clamoring for artist catalogs, and the prevalence of familiar samples are all part of the same story, and they mimic the consolidation of IP that happened in film over the past 20 years. Just as in the multiplex, the only properties that play on a global scale are the universally known ones—Super Mario Bros., live-action Disney remakes, movies based on sneakers and dolls and board games— and no one involved feels all that much like taking chances. “It’s easier to keep the flame very high than it is to start a song from nothing,” explains Shukat.\nMercuriadis echoes this idea. “You probably won’t get many people that will admit this,” he says, “but when you’re dealing with such amazing songs, our life is actually really easy.” As an example of a relatively hard sell when it comes to modern hitmaking, he cites the recent Coi Leray song “Players.” “This is a new artist, and it doesn’t matter how amazing the song is, you still have to convince all of these different people that the song is great,” he says. “Whereas for us, we don’t have to convince anyone that the song is great. They already know that our songs are great.” Mercuriadis doesn’t acknowledge the evident irony in his example—Leray’s track, which has been streamed 222 million times on Spotify, is built on a sample of Grandmaster Flash’s 1982 track “The Message,” one of the most important songs in hip-hop history, and Leray’s verses contain near-quotes of Jay-Z’s “Dirt Off Your Shoulder,” Puff Daddy’s “It’s All About the Benjamins,” and even Nate Dogg’s hook from “Tha Next Episode.”\nShukat, for his part, still has ideas he’s eager to put into production. His white whale is the whistled outro to Otis Redding’s “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay,” which Primary Wave owns. (He acknowledges De La Soul already sampled the whistle on 1989’s 3 Feet High and Rising—an album that, until very recently, was stuck in clearance purgatory and left off streaming services.) He’s been pestering a singer named LP who he proclaims is “the greatest whistler ever,” and he’s had some producers working on a beat. “You start hitting play for enough people, and someone will write something great to it,” he says. “And we’ll go from there.”",

They couldn’t have done it without the pop, rock, and rap stars who were willing to use their fame for a cause.\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2020-10-29\ncategories: ['features']\ntags: ['politics']\n---\nOn June 8, 1990, an undercover cop walked into a Fort Lauderdale record store, picked up a copy of 2 Live Crew’s As Nasty as They Wanna Be, and promptly arrested the man behind the counter. The Miami rap group was no longer free to be, well, as nasty as they wanted to be. In light of pop music’s increased tension with parent groups and conservatives, a federal judge had ruled the record legally obscene, and therefore illegal to sell.\nThree days after the arrest, 2 Live Crew performed songs from the album at a nightclub in nearby Hollywood, Florida; afterwards, two of its members, Luther Campbell and Chris Won Wong, were stopped by local police and charged with “certain acts in connection with an obscene, lewd performance.” They would later be acquitted, but their arrest was a turning point in a long-simmering conflict between the government and the music industry—one that would eventually result in young music fans voting en masse.\nIn 1985, the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) successfully lobbied to place a parental guidance warning on albums containing sexual, violent, or otherwise explicit content inappropriate for young listeners. Senate hearings were held before record labels started voluntarily slapping warnings on their wares, and artists as disparate as John Denver, Dee Snider, and Frank Zappa brought their rightful ire to the stand. “It was quasi-government censorship, and it had a chilling effect on free speech of the artists,” says Jeff Ayeroff, who was then an executive at Virgin Records.\nA vocal critic of the PMRC, Ayeroff had cut his teeth in the creative departments of A&M and Warner Bros. Records. He’d worked with some of the talent the committee found to be particularly “objectionable,” including two key players on their “Filthy Fifteen” list: Prince, whose “Darling Nikki” topped the list, and Madonna, the committee’s dirty muse of sorts. (Susan Baker, the wife of treasury secretary James Baker, established the committee with future Second Lady Tipper Gore after her young daughter had asked her to explain the lyrics to “Like a Virgin.”) Now, just a few years later, Ayeroff was witnessing the actual outlawing of albums—no doubt the influence of the PMRC-led culture wars. He knew he needed to act.\nAyeroff saw a connection between the deepening cultural canyon, and age difference, between the record-buying public and this committee of “mothers protecting people from music,” who had close ties to lawmakers. He was sick of conservatives weaponizing popular music, specifically rap and rock, as a way to scare older voters while ignoring the interests of young ones. The PMRC was well-connected in Washington, but Ayeroff was well-connected in the entertainment industry. He could bring his experience and network to an initiative that ostensibly countered these stifling politics and encouraged young voters to get involved. With the help of his assistant, Beverly Lund, and his partner at Virgin, Jordan Harris, Ayeroff founded Rock the Vote, a bipartisan nonprofit organization focused on voters between the ages of 18 and 29, before 1990 was even over.\n“The reality is, the big stars, we don’t make [them]—we just turn them onto things and put the money behind them,” he says. “The same idea applies to politics, to getting kids to vote. If I can market Madonna, Prince, and the Talking Heads, I can market voting.”\nOver the course of his tenure at A&M and Warner, Ayeroff had helped put together some of the more memorable music videos of the 1980s, from the Police’s “Every Breath You Take” to A-Ha’s “Take On Me.” He was a self-described “prime supplier” for MTV since its earliest days. Now the network was facing pressure from the PMRC to adjust its programming, due to concerns including the “exceptional savagery” of heavy metal videos. Ayeroff pitched his new project to MTV founder and former president/CEO Tom Freston, who was already interested in diversifying the network’s offerings with socially minded programming.\n“We had determined that rather than just play music videos, which were beginning to wear a bit, we could also be about [what] the music was about: news, fashion, politics,” Freston says. “Those were things our audience was also interested in.” MTV had amassed millions of viewers since it launched in 1981, and Freston wanted to use its sizable influence for good.\n“For the first time ever in the world, there was one radio station, and it just so happened to be on television,” says Ayeroff of MTV’s reach at the time. “Kids all over the country would see the same program, see the same videos, hear the same interviews. They would watch the same commercials.” Crucially, they would also see the same public service announcements.\nBefore the 1990 midterm elections, Ayeroff knew the darling of his former label, Madonna, had time coming up in the recording studio with one of his artists at Virgin, Lenny Kravitz. He scheduled brief shoots with their respective teams. The goal was to create a public service announcement with the look and feel of a music video, one that could run as counter-programming to the actual videos on MTV—and one that was easy for the artists, their labels, and Rock the Vote to pull off.\n“You say to the manager, ‘Ask your artist if they want to do a Rock the Vote spot. We’ll do it inside the budget of your own video shoot: You spend another two hours or 20 minutes on the set, depending on how simple an idea it is, and we’ll get you more visibility vis-a-vis airplay,’” explains Ayeroff of the early process. “It was like getting a free ad on MTV.”\nThere was just one minor snag: Neither Madonna nor Lenny had registered to vote before filming their PSAs. (From then on, voter registration forms were brought to Rock the Vote shoots.) Still, the Madonna shoot in particular was inspired. Directed by Paula Greif, who’d helmed videos for Duran Duran and the Smiths, the PSA actually came to life in the director’s West Village apartment. Greif’s place was bathed in natural light, so she invited Madonna and her dancers over.\n“It was shot in a simple way on this white background, to be very graphic and very direct,” Greif says. “She brought an American flag to wrap herself in, but she didn’t have anything to wear [underneath]. I had some red underwear that I gave to her. Someone stole the red underwear—it disappeared that day!”\nGreif’s frequent collaborator, culture writer Glenn O’Brien, tweaked the lyrics of Madonna’s “Vogue” to give it a political update. Soon, the most popular pop star on the planet was draped in an American flag and riffing on her then-biggest hit with a Rock the Vote twist: “Dr. King, Malcolm X / Freedom of speech is as good as sex… Don’t just sit there, let’s get to it / Speak your mind, there’s nothing to it.” It was nothing short of iconic. “We were talking to music lovers and just trying to get them to vote,” Greif adds. “We tried to make voting cool, basically, and I think we did.”\nFreston puts it more bluntly: “The minute we saw it, we played it all day long.”\nFrom then on, artists across the pop spectrum—from Michael Jackson to Deee-Lite to LL Cool J—took Ayeroff’s prompt and ran with it. Megadeth’s 1990 PSA was a striking contrast to Madonna’s, as the guys all posed with an American flag, completely silent, with gaffing tape covering their mouths as YOUR VOTE IS YOUR VOICE flashed beneath them on the screen. R.E.M. filmed multiple PSAs, and in conjunction each copy of their smash 1991 album, Out of Time, was sold with a postcard petition for the Motor Voter Bill, which ensured that people could register to vote at the DMV.\nIn the lead-up to the 1992 presidential election, Aerosmith goofed off with their own “Bill of Rights” PSA, one that celebrated “the right to make love in an elevator.” Madonna recorded another PSA in 1992, where she chatted about the voting process with the raunch and camp of a ’90s Mae West. “[Voting is] kind of like sex with my boyfriend,” she drawled. “I mean, what do I get out of it? I’ll tell you what I get out of it: A good night’s sleep, because if I have to listen to him complain one more night about how I’m not a responsible citizen of this country...”\nThe first presidential election in Rock the Vote’s history was a win, both for the organization and its preferred administration (Tipper Gore notwithstanding). The Choose or Lose: Facing the Future with Bill Clinton town hall, a joint venture between Rock the Vote and MTV, made for instant legend. The Facing the Future audience was full of prospective voters in Rock the Vote’s coveted demographic: teens and young adults sporting scrunchies, T-shirts, goatees, and Contempo Casuals sundresses volleyed questions at Clinton about everything from Anita Hill (he said he believed her) to his first “rock’n’roll experience” (loving Elvis). Affable and at ease, Clinton made it clear that no topic was off-limits, not even drugs (“I didn’t inhale”) and his preferred style of underwear (boxers).\nWhen he won the election, young voters played a crucial part in his victory. There was a 37 percent increase in participation in voters between the ages of 18 and 24 compared to the previous presidential election, the largest turnout for that group since 18-year-olds were given the right to vote in 1972. MTV and Rock the Vote threw their own inaugural ball to celebrate, where Clinton made a point of thanking them.\n“I think his exact words were ‘MTV and Rock the Vote were a major reason’ that he won the election,” Freston says. “That would just send a chill down your spine. [MTV] started out in the gutter in 1981, and 11 years later, you’ve got the President of the United States crediting you in part for helping get him elected.”\nAfter the rousing success of their inaugural presidential campaign, Rock the Vote revved up once again four years later. In 1996, one of the artists leading its charge was Sheryl Crow, who’d broken through a few years earlier with a folksy rock sound and was on the brink of releasing her self-titled second album. Like Ayeroff, Crow had been incensed by the threat of censorship brought on by the PMRC; she would later frequent Capitol Hill to advocate for musicians’ rights in regards to copyright and other matters. One of her earliest appearances with the organization involved clicking through the very first online voter registration form and demonstrating how to use this newfangled technology for a small group that included Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy.\n“It’s funny because the internet was a new thing, and I was like, ‘What is it called?! The world wide web?’” Crow recalls, laughing. “I remember introducing that, and it was like a new video game: ‘And then you tap this, and then you go here, and then that’s going to take you to here.’”\nFor Crow, Rock the Vote’s youth outreach wasn’t unlike the engaged dinner-table conversations she’d have with her parents—one liberal, one conservative—back in Missouri, and that aspect of the organization’s mission compelled her to answer Ayeroff’s call. “The younger generation that may be feeling hopeful, disenfranchised, or apathetic—that’s not a new thing for that age group,” she says. “Rock the Vote really tapped into that, and still does. They say, ‘You live in a country that’s amazing in the fact that you are [supposed] to be guaranteed the right to a safe voting experience, and it’s your duty to show up and be a part of that.’”\nChuck D also began working with Rock the Vote in 1996. Like Crow, he had grown up in the ‘60s and ’70s, and galvanizing events like the protests against the Vietnam War left an imprint on his political consciousness. Fans of the Public Enemy leader knew him for his lyrical bombast and dexterity with socio-political commentary, and he brought that same insurrectionary spirit to his PSA. Referencing his group’s indelible “Fight the Power,” Chuck stands on a bustling Brooklyn sidewalk and asks: “What is power? Can you feel it, see it, hear it? Nah, but you know it’s real when it’s against you.”\n“I was clear from the jump that I come from a different time, where people got beat down for the vote,” he says. “I wanted to be able to get involved with a situation that used culture at the particular time to at least [encourage] people to think for themselves. I thought I could energize people younger than me to understand that voting was as essential as washing your ass in the morning. You don’t have to vote, but you can’t go around telling people that something stinks.”\nStarting with the 1996 election, Rock the Vote knew they had to go further than the limits of MTV. They started sending artists into the field—meeting with voters in swing states and performing at Rock the Vote concerts—and helped revive the role of popular musicians in politics in the process. In 2000, Chuck D worked with the organization on Rap the Vote, a joint effort with Russell Simmons to mobilize young Black voters. Four years later, a Rock the Vote bus tour rolled through 50 cities across the country with a rotating lineup that included the Snoop Dogg/Nate Dogg/Warren G supergroup 213, Q-Tip, the Black Eyed Peas, the Donnas, and the (Dixie) Chicks, who had just infuriated country radio with their passionate criticism of George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq.\nDespite this heightened engagement, the first half of the 2000s represented a dark time for Rock the Vote—in addition to Bush’s election and re-election, the organization faced financial woes in 2006, though it eventually recovered. But Barack Obama’s presidential bid revived interest in the young electorate, and artists ramped up their support, too. Crow even gave away free downloads of her 2008 album, Detours, to those who registered through Rock the Vote, motivated in part by her feeling that the American people had been lied to by President Bush regarding Iraq. After visiting Obama’s campaign headquarters shortly before the election, she ended up performing at his inaugural festivities in 2009.\n“Standing in a vast field of people watching a Black man being inaugurated was one of the greatest moments,” Crow says. “To me, there was a direct correlation to having gone out and campaigned for him—but not only that, having gotten people to register to vote, no matter what side they stood on, no matter what their political beliefs were.”\nBy the 2008 election, Rock the Vote had registered their two-millionth voter. Obama’s historic victory was particularly meaningful for Ayeroff, who felt Obama embodied everything he had hoped Rock the Vote could achieve.\n“People say that politics is just show business with ugly people, until you get to Clinton, who was handsome, and Obama—and then all of a sudden politics is like show business,” he says. “I looked at Obama and I said, ‘This guy’s a fuckin’ rock star.’ He was, to me, the fruition of the idea of youth voting—the idea that the electorate changes, and ultimately, that the politicians would change.”\nRock the Vote continued to build relationships with artists who weren’t afraid to step into the political arena, or who had long since found their place within it. The next generation of pop stars would channel Madonna’s PSA in subsequent decades: Christina Aguilera, holding her newborn son, wrapped herself in the flag and sang “America the Beautiful” for her 2008 PSA.\nThe scope of Rock the Vote’s operation has grown since then, evolving to meet the moment: Instead of on-air PSAs, recent campaigns—like their Voter Registration Day push bearing a Shepard Fairey portrait of Snoop Dogg—have been tailored more to the Instagram set. Midterm elections, historically, receive a dismal response from young voters, and Rock the Vote targeted that disinterest in 2014 with a Lil Jon-led “Turn Out For What” video that threw back to the high-profile PSAs of years’ past. They registered close to 700,000 voters that year, a vast improvement from the 250,000 they’d signed up for the prior midterms, with 20 percent of that age group casting a ballot. That number was eclipsed in 2018, when it rose to 31 percent and broke records for the highest youth turnout since the ’80s. Crow may have tried out the very first virtual registration form, but celebrities are now powering their own youth outreach efforts with Rock the Vote’s registration technology, as LeBron James did this year with his organization, More Than a Vote.\nAs for Snoop Dogg, he may have participated in Rock the Vote events in the past, but the 2020 election will mark his first time voting. According to Carolyn DeWitt, Rock the Vote’s president and executive director, Snoop was led to believe that he didn’t have the right to vote due to his criminal record. “The message that he’s sending isn’t just ‘I’m voting for the first time and you should, too,’” she says, “but also that we have to investigate what our rights are when it comes to having a voice in the future of our community.”\nRock the Vote has continued to reach voters across genres and generations by sticking to Ayeroff’s initial plan: put the music industry to work for the greater good. In spite of the staggeringly high stakes of this year’s election, he’s encouraged by the efforts he’s seen from young people, from the activism of Marjory Stone Douglas High School students to Billie Eilish, who will vote in her first presidential election this year and is vocally encouraging her fans to do the same. The celebrities, PSAs, and successful social media campaigns have all done their part, but the message has always been more important than the medium.\n“There is one thing that ties this all together,” Ayeroff says. “The youth vote has the potential to save the world.”\nDisclosure: The writer was previously employed by MTV News.",

As the singer’s former assistant and creative director, Crawford was indispensable to Houston as she ascended to superstar status. But there was always tabloid gossip surrounding their relationship, especially once Crawford left the music industry in 2000: Were the two simply childhood friends, or was it something deeper than that? The truth, as revealed in Crawford’s stunning memoir A Song for You, is much more complicated. She pays homage to her best friend with fond, funny, sometimes-tragic anecdotes, from their initial romantic connection as camp counselors in New Jersey to blow-ups with Bobby Brown and Houston’s mother, Cissy, years later. Crawford writes with pathos, clarity, and tenderness while tracing the tragedies that rocked her family and the Houstons. –Eric Torres\nBass, Mids, Tops: An Oral History of Sound System Culture\n“Bass is fundamental,” writes Joe Muggs in this book’s introduction. It’s physical, not cerebral, he says, “reaching through walls and floors, propagating outwards, marking out social (and antisocial) spaces.” Bass, Mids, Tops is an attempt to follow those shock waves back to their source—the sound-system culture of Britain’s Caribbean immigrant communities—and then trace their reverberations through lovers-rock reggae and post-punk, through hip-hop, jungle, grime, dubstep, and beyond. Muggs interviews multiple generations of players—people like Dennis Bovell, a Barbadian dub selector who ran one of London’s most influential sound systems before producing everyone from the Slits to Linton Kwesi Johnson; Storm, a drum’n’bass DJ who, along with her late partner Kemistry, co-founded the influential Metalheadz label in the ’90s; and Mala, whose ’00s dubstep duo Digital Mystikz was responsible for a sound “as pure and strange as anything in British electronic history.” Told entirely through candid interviews (accompanied by portraits from Brian David Stevens), Bass, Mids, Tops is an engrossing tale of sounds ricocheting around the world—and an instinctive allegiance to frequencies more felt than heard. –Philip Sherburne\nCruel to Be Kind: The Life and Music of Nick Lowe\nA natural-born raconteur and a perpetually underrated songwriter, Nick Lowe has stories for miles—he just had no inclination to put them down on the page. Enter writer Will Birch, a fellow survivor of Britain’s rough-and-tumble ’70s pub rock scene, who was not only a first-hand witness to Lowe’s misadventures but knew all the supporting players, too. As such, Cruel to Be Kind doesn’t shy away from Lowe’s excesses and mistakes, but the book also prefers to emphasize his charms while explaining, for example, why it took him a decade to finish “The Beast in Me” for his one-time father-in-law Johnny Cash, or how he electrocuted himself during one of his first concerts with his early band, Brinsley Schwarz. Taken all together, these stories make for a book that’s as warm, funny, and affecting as Lowe’s best songs. –Stephen Thomas Erlewine\nDarkly: Black History and America’s Gothic Soul\nEarly on in Darkly, writer and Brooklyn Public Library Creative Director Leila Taylor sums up her teenage fondness for all things goth: “I didn’t have to talk about my feelings; the poster for Joy Division’s Closer did it for me.” Taylor begins her cultural history by discussing the dark, distinctive aesthetics of Siouxsie and the Banshees and the self-created mythology of cult electronic duo Drexciya. From there, she ventures into Edgar Allan Poe’s racism, the intertwined legacies of slavery and horror stories, and the troubling appeal of “ruin porn.” By the time Taylor returns to music, analyzing the gothic elements of black performers like Screamin’ Jay Hawkins (over-the-top vocals, coffins on stage) and M Lamar (operatic inflections, allusions to historical trauma), the reader will likely see the topic through a new sociopolitical lens. Darkly is a haunting reminder of how the horrific corners of American history have shaped generations of musicians. –Tobias Carroll\nGo Ahead in the Rain: Notes to A Tribe Called Quest\nGo Ahead in the Rain isn’t just a love letter to one of the greatest hip-hop groups ever—it’s also a brilliant poet unpacking his formative connections to the beats, the wordplay, and the jazz that set Tribe apart. And Abdurraqib, to his credit, doesn’t ignore the group’s missteps either. “They made the album the genre wanted, not the album they wanted to see in the genre,” he says of 1996’s Beats, Rhymes and Life, the first time the group’s winning streak slipped. Writing on what was once Tribe’s final record, 1998’s spiritless The Love Movement, Abdurraqib notes, “It felt like the ease with which they approached their past efforts was out the window.” You can feel his heartbreak: the crew that soundtracked his life became a pop-culture footnote. A panoramic view of Tribe tucked inside a personal history, Go Ahead in the Rain examines how young fandom evolves into something more like true adoration. –Marcus J. Moore\nRead Pitchfork’s full review of Go Ahead in the Rain\nThe Hard Times: The First 40 Years\n“Crust Punk Hops Train to Parents’ Lake House.” “Straight-Faced Guy With Arms Crossed Having Best Night of His Life.” “Supportive Girlfriend Shouldn’t Be.” For the past five years, The Hard Times has been churning out amusing, spot-on pieces satirizing the punk, hardcore, and indie worlds with a consistency that rivals The Onion in its prime. This book collects the website’s best writing but also adds a fictionalized history of The Hard Times that imagines its rise and fall from the 1970s through the mid-’00s, complete with era-appropriate content. (Sample ’80s headline: “Report: Sheena Is an Investment Banker Now.”) It is 250 pages of nonstop LOLs, even when the headlines hit just a liiittle too close to home (see: “Zine Editor Extends Submission Deadline for Eighth and Final Time,” “Aging Punk Loses Battle to Comfortable Clothes”). With its quick, single-page articles, The Hard Times: The First 40 Years could be considered a great punk-rock bathroom book—even if “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside Morrissey’s Touring Band” didn’t make the cut. –Amy Phillips\nHigh School\nFrom their very first battle of the bands in high school, Tegan and Sara Quin’s musical coming-of-age story was a great one—the tale of twin underdogs taking on the world. In their variously hilarious and devastating page-turner of a memoir, they take turns writing chapters about those germinal teenage years that inevitably shape your perspective on the whole world. Between the sleepovers, concerts, fights, and dreams, High School is a testament to the messiness and wisdom of youth and the psychological complexities of identical twindom. Tegan and Sara experiment with acid, sneak out to raves, navigate their earliest relationships with other young women, and along the way they find their sharp, honest voices—together and apart. –Jenn Pelly\nMechanical Fantasy Box: The Homoerotic Journal of Patrick Cowley\nIn addition to his queer dancefloor masterpieces, visionary producer Patrick Cowley made mind-blowing, body-pleasing soundtracks for ’70s gay porn flicks. He enacts those film’s scenarios in Mechanical Fantasy Box, a collection of his journals published with fabulous new illustrations by Gwenaël Rattke and a compilation of unreleased recordings. These brief-but-brilliant details are dispatched from the gay fantasia of late-’70s San Francisco, cruise rooms full of pot smoke and poppers and Vaseline and the kind of “menergy” Cowley would immortalize in song. At one point the producer recounts telling a buddy, “I know I’m going to be 50 yrs old and be able to look back and say, ‘I spent what I had to spend and used what was mine to use as it was intended.’ I loved it up.” Cowley died of AIDS-related causes at 32, but otherwise he was goddamn right. We’re lucky to still feel his love—and to read his diary. –Jesse Dorris\nThe Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else: Joy Division: The Oral History\nIn The Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else, longtime punk historian Jon Savage chronicles Joy Division’s four-year existence and eternal influence, as told by the group’s surviving members and extensive inner circle. Savage’s interviews reveal aspects of the post-punk band’s legend that even diehard fans may not know, including wonderfully detailed anecdotes of gigs both failed and spectacular. The story of Joy Division didn’t end with the death of frontman Ian Curtis, nor did it really even begin with him. The Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else shows how four young men channeled their working-class restlessness and the bleakness of industrial Manchester into something beautiful and crushing that endures to this day. –Noah Yoo\nSoulless: The Case Against R. Kelly\n2019 was the year that finally took R. Kelly down. In January, dream hampton’s docuseries Surviving R. Kelly inspired investigations and, eventually, charges against Kelly from law enforcement in multiple states. Then, in June, Jim DeRogatis published Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly, a book born out of decades of close reporting on Kelly’s life and crimes. It is significant not only for its detailed investigative work but for its masterful exploration of journalism as a fundamental component of justice. DeRogatis maps Kelly’s escalating behavior in private alongside his rising star in public and, in doing so, offers an indictment of the criminal justice system, the press, and the music industry for facilitating Kelly’s abuse. Soulless is a book as much about one man’s violence as it is about a society’s cowardly complicity. –Rawiya Kameir\nRead Pitchfork’s full review of Soulless\nTime Flowing Backwards: A Memoir\nIf you’re already interested in the vital indie rock of New Zealand during the 1980s and ’90s, then Graeme Jefferies’ memoir is a must-read. But even if you’ve never heard of Jefferies’ intense post-punk bands Nocturnal Projections, This Kind of Punishment, and the Cakekitchen, Time Flowing Backwards is a compelling tale of one musician’s decades-long attempts to scrape by. Opening in 1990, when he bought a one-way ticket to London, Jefferies chronicles all the squatting, busking, and odd jobs he cobbled together around Europe before landing back in New Zealand, all while constantly reinventing the Cakekitchen. He also details the creation of specific songs on a fascinatingly granular level, but Time Flowing Backwards is most absorbing whenever Jefferies has lost a gig or an apartment or a relationship and has to figure out what to do next. “I came very close to disaster several times,” he admits. “But I never quite fell down the hole to a point where I couldn’t crawl back out again.” –Marc Masters\nWalk This Way: Run-DMC, Aerosmith, and the Song that Changed American Music Forever\nHow did a washed-up sleaze-rock band help bring hip-hop to the MTV masses? That story, told in precise detail by Washington Post arts reporter Geoff Edgers, is also the story of Run-DMC and their producer Rick Rubin, an ambitious NYU kid with wild ideas about fusing rap and rock. (It was Rubin who convinced a skeptical Run-DMC to collaborate with a strung-out Aerosmith in the first place, though there’s plenty of contradictory lore about who implanted that idea in the producer’s head.) The book’s scope spans a decade, but its focus zeroes in on just five minutes and 17 seconds—the runtime of Run-DMC’s genre-busting 1986 “Walk This Way” cover—in order to reveal how the song transformed pop culture for good: by solidifying rap’s mainstream appeal and knocking down white-dominated programming formats. If you buy into Edgers’ thesis, this moment represented for rap “the kind of historic marker that rock experienced when Elvis thrust his pelvis on The Milton Berle Show.” And even if you don’t, it’s hard not to be sucked in by the author’s eye for incidental details, like Steven Tyler snorting coke in the studio bathroom while history was being made. –Zach Schonfeld\nWhy Karen Carpenter Matters\nWhy Karen Carpenter Matters is about the kind of chart-topping suburban pop that lies at the core of white capitalist mythology—sunny and sentimental, meticulously calibrated for Nixon-era FM radio. But the book centers those at the margins of American society, revealing how the Carpenters’ music resonated with immigrants, LGBTQ folks, and people of color who craved the idyllic normalcy that the siblings embodied. Tongson would know: She is, in her own words, a butch lesbian, and her Filipino musician parents named her after Karen Carpenter. In this exploration of her namesake’s legacy, she deftly weaves memoir, history, and cultural criticism to highlight the dynamic relationship between artists and listeners—all the while avoiding the militant “yasss girl” identity politics that have come to define modern fandom. Music seeps into our lives in confounding ways, Tongson appears to say; even the most seemingly banal pop can surprise us. –Cat Zhang\nYear of the Monkey\nPatti Smith’s latest memoir, Year of the Monkey, feels like the next logical step following the liminal fantasy of 2015’s M Train—or a more focused continuation of Smith’s spontaneous onstage freestyling. The book’s vignettes are vivid and arresting; Smith expertly navigates the edges around our willful suspension of disbelief, pushing at the corners, expanding the spaces in our imaginations so they’re expansive enough to ride along with her. But what grounds this work is the mundane, whether it’s forgetting her phone charger on the road, or the comfort she takes in her long-standing friendships, even as they fade. It’s a slim volume that’s easy to inhale, but when you finish, you might find yourself slightly off-kilter, and sad that it’s over so soon. –Caryn Rose",
