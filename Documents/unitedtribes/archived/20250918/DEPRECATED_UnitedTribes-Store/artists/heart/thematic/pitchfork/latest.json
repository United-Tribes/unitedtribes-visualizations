Larson’s review of the album.\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2025-06-24\n---\nLittle Richard would prop one leg up on the piano and bang chords with his foot. Jerry Lee Lewis would stand on the piano and stomp the keys. Pete Townshend would smash his guitar to bits. Jimi Hendrix would play guitar behind his head and pretend to have sex with it and then light it on fire. James Brown would pretend to faint then miraculously revive himself. Michael Jackson moonwalked. David Lee Roth did the splits in the air. Freddie Mercury wielded the top half of a microphone stand. Prince would flip the microphone stand up off the stage with his feet, in heels. Elton John wore sequined tuxedos. Deadmau5 wore a giant foam mouse head. Matty Healy ate raw meat. Ozzy Osbourne ate a bat. GG Allin ate his own shit. Benson Boone does backflips.\nTo be a real showman takes charisma, magnetism, or what they used to call moxie in this business. I’d say it’s a lost art, except the art of the showman is the lingua franca of the online generation. Scroll down any social media feed far enough and witness the new Vaudevillian theatre, an endless line of people auditioning just for you, stealing your attention through some feat, stunt, bit, dance, or trick. Here is the family of oafs who rates Costco food, a cringe dad and his sons who learn all the TikTok dances, the crew who goes dødsing off a dam, the jock trick shot brothers, the DJ on four decks spamming hot cues, the 12-year-old guitarist, the six-year-old drummer, the baby with a noise side project, the guy who walks around New York making songs on a mobile production rig, or the guy who is one of only a few people in the world who learned to do a standing double backflip.\nThis makes the classic showman—much less the utterly jejune single-backflipping showman—rather conventional. And still, Boone has boinged himself into the global consciousness through his enormous 2024 hit “Beautiful Things.” I’m not one to argue in bad faith, so let me just say that Boone is not just regular talented but rather talented. More talented than me, that’s for sure. I can’t backflip; I can’t sing like he can; I’ve never dropped out of two separate institutions—Brigham Young University and American Idol—to pursue my childhood dream of being a pop star. To admire Boone is like drunkenly admiring an Olympian, in that you’re like, I could probably do this, but you almost certainly cannot.\nIt’s also important to note that Boone has the drop on us critics here. He’s aware that, following his show-stopping Grammys performance earlier this year, he might be pegged as a one-trick pony forever trying to top the two-billion streaming hit that brought him here. The music video for the lively “Mr Electric Blue,” a dim highlight from his mercifully brief second album, American Heart, begins with a sketch of Boone being summoned into the office of his slimy agent, played by his real-life producer and songwriting partner, Jack LaFrantz. Boone is, indeed, wearing a shirt that says “One Hit Wonder.”",

The line resurfaces two songs later on “Have a Nice Time Life!,” suggesting that it might be something like a motto for the duo of Al Nardo and Bailey Wollowitz: Zapping across decades’ worth of brightly colored, hi-def pop tropes as though flicking through channels with the cable remote, fantasy of a broken heart seem to be racing to keep pace with the speed of their ideas.\nNardo and Wollowitz, supporting players with Water From Your Eyes and This Is Lorelei who first played together in Sloppy Jane, assembled Chaos Practitioner from recordings made at home and brief blasts of creativity on tour. Stitching the pieces together with the assistance of Water From Your Eyes’ Nate Amos, the duo distills the genre-hopping art pop of last October’s Feats of Engineering into a dense, restless EP that packs six songs into just 19 minutes.\nThe whiplash pace of Chaos Practitioner is less a visceral sensation than a head trip. fantasy of a broken heart fill every corner of the margins with busy doodles: springy drum programming, processed vocals, strange time signatures, throwback electronics. Nervous overdubs and compulsive countermelodies undercut their fondness for sumptuous soft rock, creating a woozy sway that’s heightened rhythms that skitter around the beat without settling into a groove for long.\nThat velocity can be invigorating. “Passion Clouds” gallops out of the gate with a cheerful, insistent pulse—part motorik, part indie pop—before a zig-zagging rhythm threatens to overwhelm the melody of the chorus. The duo pulls off a similar misdirection on “Victory Path,” submerging the song’s hooks in thick, dissonant layers of lysergic vocoder. They succumb to soft rock on the country-inflected “Road Song,” which sounds like a 4K version of some of Jim O’Rourke’s experiments in classic rock and pop, but even here, they seem determined to avoid anything approaching a straight path. Despite their tuneful inclinations, fantasy of a broken heart are unable to resist the pull of gleeful cacophony; an impish sense of humor runs through their colorful arrangements even when the sentiment—as on “We Confront the Demon in Mysterious Ways,” a song about toxic relationships—runs much darker.\nSometimes, fantasy of a broken heart appear so intent upon subverting established pop forms that they seem to lack the patience to write a song that ebbs and flows of its own accord. That’s not the case with “We Confront the Demon in Mysterious Ways,” which retains the spirited energy that drives the EP but eases into a more linear, relaxed groove and draws it out for nearly five minutes—the longest song here by a considerable margin. It feels like a coda to the frenetic explosion of sounds that has preceded it, a satisfying conclusion to an EP that contains more ideas than many records three times its length. After darting from peak to peak across the previous five songs, fantasy of a broken heart finally find the time to slow down and take in the view.",

It’s angels on Angel Dust. It’s all the music you’re lucky if you got into as a younger millennial: nü-metalcore breakdowns, Pepper Ann pop-punk, mungy Cali funk metal, cheap-seat arena rock, and orchestral goth grandeur, with a fugitive whiff of Goapele’s East Bay classic “Closer” perfuming the air. Tracey Thorn once theorized that the heart remains a child. Here’s a record that kicks and screams to prove it.\nCabral describes Portrait of My Heart as an album about “love, intimacy, anxiety and alienation,” and the 33-year-old Bay Area artist paints these emotions as so powerful that the natural world cracks and bends to their will. Love is like a flood, loss is like a hole opening in the sky. “It’s unreal, what the heart can hold,” she sings on “Waterfall.” It’s easy to detect a narrative of a breakup followed by tentative new love as kiss-offs like “Alibi” lead into the new dawn of “Destiny Arrives” and “Mount Analogue,” but Cabral hasn’t been specific about the personal circumstances at play. What matters is that you can project the weathers of your own heart onto her music—that one of the songs on Portrait might mean as much to you as much as “You Oughta Know” might’ve meant to the generation before Cabral’s or “Good 4 U” to the generation immediately after.\nThese romantic-outsider yarns fit nicely with Cabral’s persona as a modern-day mystic, drunk on her own strangeness. When she sings “I don’t belong here” on the title track, we can read it as a literal expression of alienation, as a reference to one of the great angst anthems, and as a complement to the gleeful eccentricity that animates her music. We might read it on another level, too: Cabral is a Black artist of Mexican descent, and she’s spoken of dealing with her feelings of otherness as a kid by “growing my outsider-ness as a superpower.” Like all the great glam icons (Bowie, Prince, Gaga, Grace Jones), Cabral doesn’t revel in kookiness for the hell of it but to demonstrate how to take control of one’s own narrative.\nPortrait of My Heart brings in outside producers for the first time, including Rob Bisel, who’s worked with SZA, and Psymun, who’s worked with Yves Tumor. These earlier credits are relevant, the former as the kind of acerbic singer-songwriter superstar who thrived in the Morissettian mid-1990s, the latter as a denizen of the noise underground who breached the upper echelons of indie acclaim without losing their mystique. The hooks on “Alibi” and “Keep It Alive” hit with scream-along jollity, even if Cabral’s punk turn means we get less of the fairytale quality that made her earlier work bewitching—and even if the drums sound curiously flimsy at times, crushed underfoot by the guitar onslaught.",

The genius of Stories From a Rock N Roll Heart—her first new album in three years and the first since her stroke in 2020—is how she marries these two impulses. Behind her, the band acts like a Tuesday-night bar band: greasy but tame, rowdy but contained, carefully rehearsed but slightly wobbly at the edges. They sound like the kind of outfit that might cover George Thorogood or Bonnie Raitt, the Wallflowers or the Gin Blossoms—whatever keeps the tap dispensing watery beers—and over this groove, Williams reminisces about “staying up all night playing poker and pool/Playing Dylan and the Boss, and we thought we were cool.” There’s a survivor’s wonder in her voice: The fact that there even is a band, this many decades later, to get back together is cause for celebration. Enough hearts are still beating, enough friendships are intact. Hey, we could.\nIt’s also the lightest music she’s made in a decade. Over the past 10 years, Williams has peered into some darkened corners—depression, addiction, mortality, abuse, despair—and her music has often darkened with her. Perhaps a brush with death refreshes your senses for all the good old slights and discomforts of daily life, because the songs on Stories From a Rock N Roll Heart are earnest and earthbound. She indulges in the luxury to be jealous, self-deprecating, horny. These are also the most quotidian and diaristic songs she’s written in years. “Driving down Sunset/I’m stuck in traffic/With the sun coming in from the west/So I cover my eyes and I wait for the light to change/And I think about you/And it’s kinda strange/but I think about you,” the opening gambit from “Stolen Moments,” is just point-blank more words than Williams generally allows herself. Her songs have worked in brilliant broad strokes—God is a big rotator, there’s a big black train coming, she oughta know about lonely girls—but the writer we meet on Stories From a Rock N Roll Heart is a notebook scribbler, a noticer, an observer.\nOn “Last Call For the Truth,” she’s also back in the corner booth. “Give me one more taste of my lost youth/Then it’s last call for the truth,” she sings, which reads dire but comes out sounding wry. She’s been singing about lost youth ever since she had it, and now that it’s gone, she sounds fonder than ever. “Celebrating our lack of social graces/Staying true to our ragtag mystique,” she sings, with more than a touch of “2 Kool 2 Be 4 Gotten”—this might even be the same bar, with the same characters, or maybe Williams is the only regular still hanging around from those days. Maybe those are her words notched in that stall.",

Their pseudo-electronic blend of whirring guitars and trip-hop backbeats was its own strain of revivalism—the sound of Beat-era Bowery Electric’s industrial lullabies bleeding into traces of A.R. Kane’s prismatic sludge. But even among these giants of existential dread, the Irish quintet sounded uniquely tormented, winding around singer Katie Ball’s siren-call vocals and dialing into the split-second where anxiety collapses into desperation. Coming from a friend, bleak observations such as “I’m in fear of life/Had it on my mind/Said it all the time/’Cause the dead don't mind,” from “Boo,” would be cause for concern. Slathered in reverb and sent hurtling through a dizzying maze of guitar effects, Just Mustard document succumbing to the inertia of a panic attack with a biting urgency.\nRatcheting up the gloom, Heart Under sharpens the somnambulant dream-pop of their debut to pierce through the mirage of a light at the end of the tunnel. From the fog-horn drone of opener “23” to the wailing feedback freakout that closes “Rivers,” it’s clear that Just Mustard haven’t lightened up a bit during the past four years. United behind Ball’s eerie lead vocals, a role she previously split with guitarist David Noonan, the band takes the plunge into an even more entrancing darkness.\nLead single “I Am You” is a delicate high-wire act, an anthem for ego-death set against pounding drums and howling static. Grinding the creeping dread of Slint’s “Good Morning, Captain” down to a lockstep march, six-string noise piles up slowly as Ball’s plea for transformation (“Can you change my head?”) ascends until it becomes a command, parting the sea of feedback. Even during the less arresting cuts, such as “In Shade,” she goes far beyond shoegaze’s “voice-as-instrument” conceit. Building her voice from a sigh into a full-throated cry in the second chorus, she explodes from behind a wall of ice, shouting into the night. Whether she’s watching the world slip past her reflection (“Mirrors”), processing the regret of inaction (“Rivers”), or disappearing into a mournful daydream (“Early”), the thickest slabs of reverb can’t hide her talent.\nNoonan and co-guitarist Mete Kalyon favor the types of effects that send legions of gear-obsessed fans running to the front of the stage to catch a glimpse of their pedals; if their ear for groaning melodies holds up, you can expect dozens of tutorial videos dissecting their haunting tones in the not-too-distant future. The blurred rumble of their interplay seamlessly alternates between atmospheric yawns and melodic jabs. Often, they take entire choruses for themselves, trading fours of manipulated feedback on the stomping highlight “Still” and dragging shards of noise across “Mirrors”’s tambourine-led groove-out. These moments of atonal abandon are immersive and bewildering, turning every song into a funhouse mirror.\nPlaying out like a series of snapshots from a dawnless night, Heart Under dodges catharsis or release, lingering in staggering volumes and frustrated desires. As the record comes to a close on “River,” Ball contemplates how she could have held on tighter to someone who’s slipped into the past forever, stranded on the shore of a distant memory. “Could I have changed a thing?” she muses, only to be met by a screeching tide. There is no moment of transcendence, of towering above the desolation and meeting a stronger version of yourself. It’s an anti-climax that affirms the deeply personal reality of pain. Rather than holding up a torch, Heart Under adjusts your eyes to the pitch black.\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

Inevitably, he almost falls apart less than two minutes in. “I confess the world’s a mess,” he admits softly, “but I will always love you.” You can almost sense him gazing out the window wistfully before remembering the task at hand.\nEven more surprising than the lyrical shift, however, is the music: five minutes of unabashed and (relatively) unadorned inspirational soft rock. On 2010’s The Age of Adz, Stevens embellished these types of simple pop melodies with queasy, complex arrangements that made it sound like the songs were spontaneously combusting beneath a heap of sputtering machinery. Now, he lays it bare, daring you to hold eye contact. There are rolling toms, glittery keys, call-and-response choruses, and a legit guitar solo to close things out. Love is a familiar subject, he reminds us, but it can also be radiant.\nPackaged with the similarly glowing “Love Yourself,” “With My Whole Heart” continues Stevens’ method of post-Carrie & Lowell transmissions: conceptual, out-of-the-blue, and released for a good cause. These new tracks arrive in anticipation of Pride Month and the sales benefit charities for LGBTQ+ and homeless youth. In this context, the positive message feels especially close to his heart. Along with the new songs, Stevens shared a 1996 demo of “Love Yourself” that’s shorter, starker, and less certain of its message. Like a lot of his work from this early period, it feels fragmented and vulnerable and alone: a small thought whispered into a quiet room. Here, he gives it a community.",

Probably not Ed Hardy, either. In the early 2000s, the flashy, biker culture-inspired street fashions of French designer Christian Audigier were practically synonymous with a tabloid media that eagerly splashed photos of stars like Paris, Pamela, Britney, Justin, and Jay-Z in logo-emblazoned trucker hats and teeny-tiny baby tees across supermarkets. Then, as recounted in a 2021 documentary about the brand’s absurdly colorful and criminal backstory, it all went south. By that point, of course, Von Dutch was already surging back to life, embraced by a new generation of social-media-savvy celebs like Kylie Jenner and Megan Thee Stallion. This year, rapper and reality star Sukihana wore a Von Dutch look to the Grammys.\nWhat a perfect parable for Charli XCX—Y2K-obsessed millennial, fashion icon, and notoriously under-appreciated pop talent using wicked meta-commentary to dare you to call her a flop. “Cult classic but I still pop,” she teases on new single “Von Dutch,” the first taste of an anticipated sixth solo album called Brat. Her “Von Dutch” is made of helium and hydraulics, an easyFun production with its heart in the club and its ass on a Harley. It’s another chapter in the singer-producer’s gleeful participatory parody of celebrity culture—and a banger built to go off at last weekend’s Boiler Room warehouse set (still waiting for my invite), where Charli also debuted snippets of tracks identified as “Get Into It (Spring Breakers)” and “365 Party Girl.” Pass the Jägerbombs because Brat sounds like a rager.",

Last month, the two musicians reunited on a vinyl-only single, “Can’t Replicate,” stretching Murphy’s breathy purr over a taut deep-house groove; now they shift into downbeat disco with the cozier “CooCool.” Koze has always seemed happiest when he’s being squirrely, and he tweaks tiny details—tin-can horn charts, a filigree of jazz guitar, what might be a cicada humming to itself—over a bed of warmly nostalgic ’60s soul until the laid-back track practically vibrates with antic energy. Whereas Murphy was steely and commanding on “Can’t Replicate,” adopting an ice queen’s poise, here she gives way to her most starry-eyed instincts: “That ol’ magic’s back/A warm feeling flooding/A new age of love/An incandescent joy.” At the chorus she slips into nonsense, rapturously proclaiming: “I hear a coo coo/I hear a cooing/Sweet lover coo coo.” It’s a song about the birds and the bees that asks, What if it could be springtime all the time? Or as Murphy herself puts it: “Let it be silly season, darlin’/All year round.”\nBest New Track\nGenre:\nPop/R&B / Electronic\nLabel:\nNinja Tune\nReviewed:\nMarch 8, 2023\nThe Irish singer reunites with DJ Koze for a heart-eyed disco single about the birds and the bees.",
