That might sound like an odd thing to say of a band whose most recent album is a nearly three-hour, 40-track compilation of acoustic covers of their own back catalog, but the impulse to stun, bewilder, and confound has been an animating motivation since their formation in Dublin in the mid-1970s. It’s what excited the thunderous political ardor of War in 1983; what inspired their shift toward expressive watercolor grandeur on The Unforgettable Fire; what drove them to “go away and dream it all up again” after the landmark success of The Joshua Tree caused drummer Larry Mullen Jr., to worry that the band was “turning into the world’s most expensive jukebox.” Fear of being boring might be U2’s defining feature. And it is the essence of Pop.\n“I do think that we live right now at a time, the fag end of the 20th century, where there’s a lot of nostalgia, and the musical climate is like karaoke,” Bono muses, voice even and eyes searching, halfway through U2: A Year in Pop, a 45-minute prime-time special that aired on ABC in the spring of 1997. “People aren’t liking things because they are great. They’re liking them because they remind people of something that was great.”\nIt was a complaint that Bono sounded often around the release of Pop, U2’s ninth studio album and—depending on what kind of U2 fan you ask—either their most interesting, most challenging, or least successful. In the wake of U2’s surprising reinvention as one of the most consequential popular rock bands of the 1990s, Bono had become enthralled by the pursuit of a freshly contemporary sound, and he had been pursuing it everywhere: in hip-hop and disco, techno and R&B. “When we’re at my house,” he told a reporter at the time, “it’s Sonic Youth next to Chic, into Dr. Dre or Wu-Tang Clan, into ‘Surf’s Up’ by the Beach Boys. Now, that might be a fucked up evening for some people, but that’s the way I live.”\nPractically the only thing he wasn’t interested in listening to anymore was rock—it had become too stagnant, too resistant to change. “Y’know, what is rock music now? What is it?” he asked rhetorically in Q magazine. “Because there was once a time when people hadn’t heard the sound of an electric guitar overloading through a little printed circuit going into an amp. When people heard Hendrix, that was fresh.” You wouldn’t find that pioneering spirit listening to R.E.M. or Oasis, Bono felt. You had to look further afield. As he told Time, “White-bread rock has, for me, lost its sense of adventure, and seems very tired in comparison to hip-hop.”",

The young driver had been listening to Def Leppard’s Mutt Lange-produced glam-metal opus Hysteria—and it sounded magnificent. Bono was awed. When at last it dawned on the driver who exactly he’d picked up, he switched out the Def Leppard tape for some vintage U2. By comparison, it couldn’t help but sound dull. “I think we were a little out of touch,” Bono reflected later, having heard what U2 lacked. “We weren’t as great as we figured we were.”\nIt is hard to believe that U2 were galvanized to write Achtung Baby! by a chance encounter with “Pour Some Sugar on Me” on cassette. But then that’s U2: Their art is fundamentally, inveterately emulous. The pursuit of relevance seems above all what motivates them to create. What are they doing, really, when time and again they endeavor to reinvent themselves, if not trying to remain fashionable—or, more precisely, to stave off obsolescence? In 1989, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. told Bono he worried the band was “turning into the world’s most expensive jukebox.” The band could not abide it. “They became so bored playing U2’s greatest hits that one night they went out and played the whole set backward,” Bill Flanagan writes in his biography U2 at the End of the World. “It didn’t seem to make any difference.” It’s this inclination toward boredom and restlessness that has always secretly been U2’s animating force.\nThe fear of seeming “a little out of touch”: Nearly 30 years after Bono declared on stage that the band had to “go away and dream it all up again,” this is still the prime creative catalyst. And on Songs of Experience, U2’s 14th studio album, the anxiety is more apparent than ever. Bono, it seems, has been spending a lot of time around a lot of strangers’ car stereos, and what he’s concluded U2 lacks he’s undertaken resolutely to embrace. Behold the album’s many hallmarks of the modern: There are contributions by Kendrick Lamar (“American Soul”) and Haim (“Lights of Home”), and there are flourishes that conspicuously recall the xx (“Red Flag Day”) and Arcade Fire (“Get Out of Your Own Way”). Opening track “Love Is All We Have Left” invokes a distinctly Justin Vernon-ish vocoder, an homage we might dub “Bono Iver.” And “Summer of Love”—on which Bono croons “I been thinkin’ ‘bout the West Coast/Not the one that everyone knows”—suggests someone just discovered Born to Die.",

And just as the 1991 album both fulfilled and upended rock'n'roll myths, this coffee-table-book sized, 6xCD, 4xDVD set both props up Achtung and pokes a few holes in it.\nsitename: Pitchfork\ndate: 2011-11-09\n---\n\"If you give a pop star a shit pile of dough and he refuses to self-destruct, I think it is a bit wet,\" said a smoking, slicked-back, black-sunglasses-clad Bono in a 1993 interview on the UK music show \"Naked City\". \"I think it's part of the deal. If they don't die on a cross by 33, I'd ask for your money back.\" Like many of the knowingly audacious quotes from the singer and his U2 mates during this period, it's a little tough to deduce the exact level of sincerity involved. And that was the whole idea. In the early 1990s, U2 were sending up the idea of a \"rock'n'roll star.\" They were offering themselves as an ironic, postmodern band for similarly confused times. They were making fun of themselves and their own humorless, slate-faced 80s reputation. A year after Bono's casual quip about pop stars dying on a cross, Kurt Cobain killed himself. And in Nirvana's final video, for \"Heart-Shaped Box\", Cobain could be seen making wild eyes in front of one.\nAchtung Baby and its accompanying Zoo TV tour lived within the slippage between perception and reality. \"Sometimes you can get far closer to the truth of what you're trying to say by highlighting what it isn't as if it were true,\" said the Edge on \"Naked City\". \"That's assuming we know the truth-- 'truth' is one of those words that's lost its meaning.\" In the 80s, U2 seemed endlessly in search of a definite truth, whether in peace or god or love or some ambiguous combination of the three. Famously, they didn't find it.\nBut the quest was thrilling-- at least until 1988's album and film Rattle and Hum, which found the group looking and sounding spectacularly self-serious while gawkily paying tribute to some of their American heroes like Elvis Presley and B.B. King. The resulting critical backlash caused these open-hearted Irishmen to reflect, and they weren't crazy about what they saw in the mirror. \"We looked like a big, overblown rock band running amok,\" says Bono in an excellent new documentary called From the Sky Down that chronicles the band's pivotal turn-of-the-decade moment. And while that might seem like an aptly derisive opinion of today's incarnation of U2, it's important to remember that these guys originally came out of the cacophony of rule-breaking post-punk, a realm where bloated arena rock was the enemy. So they went away and tried to come up with a new way to seek some truth.",

And that shade of uncertainty-- that \"sort of\"-- is key. Compared to U2's first three albums-- and almost everything that has come afterward-- The Unforgettable Fire is marked by a sketchy in-between-ness that works as a gracious foil to the the band's natural audacity. It's sort of stadium rock, sort of experimental, sort of spiritual, sort of subdued, sort of uncharacteristic, sort of brilliant, sort of a classic.\nAfter their first major breakthrough with 1983's War and its anthems \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"New Year's Day\", U2 could have easily continued to perfect the fist-pumping, flag-waving arena battle cry. Instead, they sought out producer Brian Eno, a bold choice for a band looking to parlay semi-success into something Springsteen-ian. While Eno is now seen as a go-to stadium savior (see: Coldplay's Viva La Vida), back then he was still the guy who coaxed magnificent weirdness out of David Bowie and Talking Heads, to say nothing of his own work, which ranged from prog-rock insanity to elegant wallpaper. The U2/Eno braintrust has since become one of the most out-and-out successful in rock history, but The Unforgettable Fire finds the pair-- along with frequent conspirator Daniel Lanois-- feeling each other out and testing limits. The album ebbs and flows along the spectrum between the spiky, post-punk U2 of old and the impressionistic, Eno-assisted U2 they were yearning to become.\nNot only were U2 and Eno an odd match musically, but their personalities clashed in a remarkable way as well. The album's interpersonal drama plays out on a half-hour making-of documentary originally released in 1984 and included in this reissue along with the remastered album and a disc of requisite B-sides and live cuts. While U2 were caricatured as honest and hardworking Irish boys who never met a stone-faced portrait they didn't admire, and Eno was the aloof London aesthete who openly mocked rock convention, you can watch the two subtly influencing each other throughout the intimate documentary. For example, after Bono is seen roiling himself into a frenzy while improvising over \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\"-- screaming, sweating, and flailing like a wounded lunatic in the recording booth-- Eno is nearly left speechless before he utters a totally sincere understatement for the ages: \"I must say, this track is really bringing something out in your singing.\" The producer's unflappable cool often leads to a fatherly kindness that goes lengths to explain his lasting appeal.",

How did these four Irishmen become the blueprint for every band with stadium aspirations? The Edge's churchly guitar chime-- which thrives on the same arena acoustics that can turn otherwise booming bands into mud-- is certainly a factor. So is their weakness for the big gesture-- whether it be a giant lemon, heart, or mouth. And Bono's cathartic mix of modern panacea-- love, God, mass culture-- gives them a reach to the back row and beyond. But, perhaps above all else, the band's restlessness and willingness to challenge both themselves and their patrons is why the Killers, Kanye West, and Coldplay want to be the next U2 and not the next AC/DC. It's why these four Irishmen still represent the punk spirit decades after they emerged from it.\n\"You've got to balance being relevant and commenting on something that's happening today with trying to attain timelessness,\" philosophized the Edge in the early 1990s. The quote sounds like rock star bullshit...until you realize that's pretty much what U2 did for 20 years. From 1980 to 2000, it was difficult to tell exactly what the next U2 album would sound like. Briefly: They added atmosphere to new wave, looked for God and found hits, exhumed their rock'n'roll heroes, sent-up those same heroes while losing their religion, and punctured pop via mutated techno. Each move was more audacious than the last-- even 1997 knee-jerk victim Pop saw the world-beating act taking completely unnecessary musical and financial risks in the name of Warholian post-modern pastiche. They then also managed to surprise on 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind by successfully returning to form after shrugging off the notion for so many years. But 2004's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and its subsequent tour were troubling.\nThat record saw four guys famous for dabbing classic rock into all sorts of impressionistic frames (or dismantling it entirely via Village People costumes) uncomfortably grasping for old-fashioned riffs, when they weren't mindlessly feasting on their own past. It was completely predictable (\"City of Blinding Lights\"), canned (\"Vertigo\"), and depressingly Sting-like (\"A Man and a Woman\"). But the group did little to hide the fact that they were basking in their early-century comeback's afterglow; in concert, in place of the ATYCLB tour's heart-shaped runway was a, um, circle-shaped runway. Still self-aware enough to sense stagnation, the quartet began to work on what would become No Line on the Horizon with new producer Rick Rubin and an imperative to break all those piling U2 trappings once again. As Bono told The New York Times this week: \"When you become a comfortable, reliable friend, I'm not sure that's the place for rock'n'roll.\"",

After debuting with Boy (1980), an album of strident post-punk, then following with a brief yet still promising hiccup (1981's October), in 1983 they released the more direct and overtly political War. Now tackling big themes and universal concerns with dramatic gestures and chest-beating choruses, U2 weren't yet an arena band but they carried themselves like one. What's more, they actually sounded better the bigger and brasher and bolder their music got. It's no surprise then that, in the U.S., this would-be Important Rock Group's profile and reputation became, like many other important rock groups, amplified via live performances-- the group's eye-opening 1985 Live Aid set, and the earlier mini concert album, Under a Blood Red Sky.\nOne of the younger bands on Live Aid's Boomer-heavy bill, U2 spent more than half of their alloted time performing \"Bad\", the standout track from their then-recent The Unforgettable Fire. While most of the bands onstage in London and Philly that weekend remained aloof and distant from the enormous crowds, Bono waded into the photo pit to embrace and slow dance with a member of the audience-- a rare moment of real human connection at what was meant to be a showcase of global unity. Only Queen and their monumental performance of \"We Are the Champions\" came off better that weekend.\nUnder a Blood Red Sky, released at the tail end of 1983, was a little less spontaneous and truthful. With its striking, scarlet-drenched cover, a shoutout to Colorado's Red Rocks on opener \"Gloria\", and the concurrent VHS release Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky (now bundled nicely as a DVD with some versions of this release), the LP was packaged to emphasize the natural beauty of the amphitheater's mountain setting. In truth, however, only two songs from Under were recorded at Red Rocks (\"Gloria\" and \"Party Girl\")-- most were taken from a show in Germany, while one performance was recorded in Boston.\nYet when the group performed at Red Rocks on a rainy June night, with lit torches above a panoramic skyline, the venue provided an ideal backdrop for U2's literally flag-waving music, with everything-- earth, wind, fire-- in place to maximize and heighten the drama of the moment and the songs. Red Rocks, too, began a love affair with America that carried through the rest of the decade, as the group's music began to match the spacious, seemingly limitless scope of the American countryside and they effectively explored American myths and touchstones on The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree before carrying the approach a step too far on the bloated, pastiche-y Rattle and Hum.",

Today, they're a powerful brand, a group with closets full of Grammys, more than 170 million records sold worldwide, stadium tours, membership in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and a lead singer whose charitable initiatives have allowed him to hold court with some of the world's most powerful people.\nIt's funny, then, to think that the band is still the same four guys who first got together in 1976 to form the Larry Mullen Band. When David \"the Edge\" Evans, Paul \"Bono\" Hewson, Larry Mullen, Jr., and Adam Clayton released their first EP, Three, in 1979, they were still teenagers with an attitude and naïveté that didn't quite dovetail with the rest of the post-punk world. Even on their earliest recordings, they didn't sound like a band that could be contained by small venues. U2 had to be big.\nThose earliest recordings are among the huge clutch of rare tracks-- studio B-sides, previously unreleased tracks, live shows, radio sessions, and remixes-- that populate the bonus discs accompanying these new reissues of the band's first three albums, 1980's Boy, 1981's October, and 1983's War. The first EP, included with Boy, isn't great, in part because the dry percussion is ill-suited to the band's (and particularly the Edge's) textural style; their debut album is another story. Produced by Steve Lillywhite, it opens with \"I Will Follow\", a surging colossus of a song that still ranks among the best tracks in the band's catalog. Bono's powerful vocals-- he got his nickname from a shorter form of Bono Vox (Good Voice)-- bring immediacy and energy to the album. And he was matched by the Edge's guitar playing, which he approached like a painter does a brush, using it as a tool to coat the canvas of the song with sound rather than resorting to basic riffs or simple strumming.\nThe version of \"Out of Control\" on Three had been dry and punky; the version on Boy is a near-anthem, with Bono's yelp transformed into an arcing croon and the Edge's slashing guitar grown into a huge, curling wave. \"A Day Without Me\" sounds like a rehearsal for an arena gig that was still years away-- the line \"started a landslide in my ego\" must have had different connotations back then for Bono than it does now. Lillywhite does a great job of capturing what made U2 unique (the Edge's remastering work is also vastly superior to the original CD transfer), and it makes sense that the band re-hired him for its rushed second album, convincing the producer to break his self-imposed rule of never working with an artist more than once.",

It's easy to look back on punk's birth more than 30 years ago-- when its mere existence was a revolution in itself-- and wonder how we got to this point. All of which makes the relentless soldiering of the Buzzcocks even more noble, as they continue to tour and record in the face of a music business destined to leech the last ounce of passion from the genre they helped to define.\nFew groups born in the chaotic early days of British punk left a more prominent influence on the modern scene than the Buzzcocks-- who concocted a sweeter, more potent mixture of melody and angst than their contemporaries-- defining a careful pop/punk formula, which for better or worse, continues to echo in today's mall punks.\nThirteen years into a reunion ignited by the 1990s alternative boom, the Buzzcocks continue to defy both expectations and age, and with 2006 marking the 30th anniversary of their first demo recording, the band has once again returned, armed with their latest full-length LP, the bristling Flat-Pack Philosophy. We recently sat down with legendary guitarist Steve Diggle to talk about the state of punk, musical legacies, and strangely, the last days of Kurt Cobain.\nPitchfork: The Buzzcocks are originally from Manchester, as are Joy Division, the Fall, the Smiths, and the Stone Roses, among others. What do you think it is about that cold industrial climate that's bred so many great British bands?\nSteve Diggle: It's still kind of got a village mentality about it in a way. And especially in the early days, there wasn't much to do. When a lot of those bands started there was plenty of time to sit and look at the light bulb. And I think that people develop things out of that, it makes you kind of have a self-realization about yourself. That's what got a lot of people thinking about that first explosion of punk. Manchester gave it a vibe, a starting point, and then that kind of hip mentality grew.\nPitchfork: Musically, there seemed to be a hunger for something new during the mid-to-late 70s. How did that desire manifest itself into the punk scene?\nSD: The thing was, the musical landscape was dead. There was really nothing happening, and nothing relevant to the modern world. I mean it was 1976 when we started, and the progressive rock bands like Yes and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer were all sounding tired, and seemed to have run their course. They were singing about mushrooms in the sky and whatnot, and we were coming up to a million unemployed in this country-- which was a first-- and there was no excitement anywhere. We were 20 then, and we needed to question our lives, and make music that was relevant to our lives. So the mushroom bit, you know, \"being away with the fairies\" didn't mean anything. What we had to do was punk rock music.\nPitchfork: It's been romanticized throughout the years, but what were those early days of the British scene really like? How did that first crop of UK punk bands define their sound?\nSD: When we started there wasn't a true definition of it in Britain. We started two days before the Clash-- and the Sex Pistols had only done two gigs-- so there was no yardstick to measure it by. All we had was the first Ramones album, and that inspired all of us. We knew the Ramones were out there, and we obviously had the Velvet Underground and Iggy as well on the American side, but on the British side we didn't have anything.\nSo that New York sound inspired us. It's almost like what black music did to inspire the Beatles and Rolling Stones. The Dolls and the Ramones-- it was an urban street music. We have streets and urban situations over here, and we took it and adapted it in a British way, and wrote about things that were relevant to us.\nPitchfork: What about the UK punk scene itself? Because the country is so concentrated, were all the bands friendly with each other? Did it feel like you were a part of a tangible movement?\nSD: We were really good friends with the Sex Pistols, because we'd seen them in London, and said, \"If you come to Manchester, we'll put a show on for you, and we'll open up for you.\" That's what happened, and then we did some of the dates on the Anarchy tour with them. Then Joe Strummer was hanging around, I met him, and then we did the White Riot tour with the Clash.\nSo particularly those three bands, we were all working very close together with each other. The Clash, the Pistols, and the Buzzcocks. And writers and photographers sort of all gravitated, and it went from there really. Then, as you know, it's got a long history now. And we're actually still good friends to this day. I mean I still see Mick Jones around London, and I remember doing the first tour with the Clash!\nPitchfork: Did you ever think the music and the messages would resonate for so long?\nSD: No. It was all meant to be immediate, direct, and for the moment. You didn't know what was going to happen. There was no time to wonder whether it was some kind of career or if it was going to last forever, or what it would mean in 10 years. It was just like \"We've got to make this point and make it now.\" You can't calculate or pontificate over art-- it has to be done instantly and spontaneously.\nIt is amazing. If you put our records on that we made all those years ago, they still sound as fresh. At the time, we got in the studio, banged the singles out, and away they went into the charts. When you look back at them now, the strength of the Buzzcocks was in the songs and the songwriting, and I think that's what's carried us through.\nPitchfork: The guitar sound and the riffs you developed played a huge role in keeping those initial singles so fresh and vital. Where did that sound come from?\nSD: That just came from our limitations really, working in the dark. The thing about the Buzzcocks is, as soon as the four of us got together in a room on the first day I just knew there was chemistry there. That just happens occasionally with bands, and it all came naturally to us. We all had a uniqueness about us that kind of worked when we all got together. We just reacted off of each other, and that gave it the Buzzcocks sound.\nPitchfork: Your songwriting was unique too, because even though you had the DIY ethic with your approach, the lyrics weren't so much about rebellion and politics as they were about great pop songs. Did you feel any pressure to be more political or topical with your songwriting?\nSD: I think we are political in some ways, though. I wrote \"Why She's the Girl from the Chain Store\", which was inspired by Henry Miller. In Black Spring, he says, \"Forget Marilyn Monroe, forget James Dean, everybody in your street is a hero.\" So I made the local store girl the hero in that. And then I spoke about Bernstein's language barrier, which says the language spoken at home is different than the language in the classroom to working class people. I put that into the lyrics of one of Joe Strummer's favorite songs, \"Autonomy\", which is about self-realization. So we had a bit of politics in there, but we didn't do that finger-pointing stuff.\nPitchfork: One of your best songs is \"Running Free\", which came right before you broke up in the early 80s. It seems really unfortunate in hindsight, because new wave was starting to hit big, and you could have had some real crossover success. How frustrating was it not to be able to capitalize on that?\nSD: We kind of got burnt out around that time, because we moved into a different area with those last three singles, and the record company was putting pressure on us, going \"These are a bit weird for the pop charts.\" Like \"Running Free\", I bought an old keyboard from somewhere and thought, \"We've got to have this on the track now, be a bit more experimental.\"\nIn a way, because we were all a bit exhausted, and we'd taken a bit too much drugs-- the cocaine and all the rest of it-- it got very rock and roll. You know, wild times, American girls-- we did a lot of partying, and I think it kind of got to us in the end. And in a way it was kind of a relief. We realized we needed a rest.\nPitchfork: I've always been kind of unclear on this. Was there a definite end to the group at that time?\nSD: It was kind of weird, because we didn't do a farewell tour or anything like that. Initially we said we'd have six months or maybe a year off, and then it just got to a point where we needed to get away from each other for a bit. I think we just kind of got burnt out and lost our way. Then Pete [Shelley] went away to do some demos, and did electronic albums. So we did our different things, and that was it. And to be honest, the boat went far out to sea-- I didn't think we'd ever get back.\nPitchfork: So then how did the reunion come about?\nSD: I had this band, Flag of Convenience, and I was playing in Paris and Berlin and stuff, and the promoter billed it as \"Buzzcocks F.O.C.\" Our agent was over there at some convention, and said, \"Hey are the Buzzcocks back?\" And I said, \"They've billed it as Steve from the Buzzcocks, but it's Flag of Convenience.\" So that was kind of the catalyst that got it back, because he said, \"Well if you guys want to do a tour of the States again...\"\nPitchfork: And how did that initial reunion go?\nSD: We hadn't been together for about six, seven years by that point. I'd seen Pete about in the club or a bar here and there, or maybe John Marley, I'd seen him around. But we all physically hadn't been in one room together for years. And I forget where the first gig was now, I think it was maybe Boston or somewhere, and there was this fantastic crowd, and this fantastic greeting for us. And it all came flooding back, which was amazing. And away we went from there. We got back and did the American tour, and we ain't stopped since.\nPitchfork: The reunion really seems like an extension of your early work too, and not just a cash-in. For a band with such a legacy, how careful were you to make sure you were coming back together for the right reasons?\nSD: Initially, we were just going to do that tour of America and leave it at that. Then the whole world wanted us to play. So we thought, \"It ain't us cashing in.\" And it extended from there. And each time we've done a tour, it's always been with a new record, so it ain't been like just regurgitating the old stuff to make money. I mean, we've never done it for that anyway. We always said if it doesn't work, we'll stop, and if it does, we'll carry on. We do it for the love and the art.\nPitchfork: What was it like when you started writing together again? With such a different social climate, did you have a clear goal as to what you wanted to accomplish lyrically?\nSD: When you're writing you're affected by everything that's going on around you. Even if the songs sound similar to what we wrote in the early days, you can't write the same. It's a different time now. There were no mobile phones, no computers, when we started writing those early songs. But like Stockhausen said, we're all just antennas that pick things up. We're still inspired by what we see and what we hear and what goes on around us. That's how we do it.\nPete writes about what he thinks, and I write about what I experience. But there's no strict criteria. I mean, it's kind of what we pick up, you know? We have dealt with a lot of different subject matters. I mean, if you listen to our lyrics, there's a lot more wisdom than the Green Day kids are writing about, you know? We write the songs we believe in, which might not always be successful sales-wise as writing some pop stuff. But If we wanted to write some cheesy fucking pop song, then we could make money a lot easier by doing that, you know what I mean?\nPitchfork: Speaking of people like Green Day, what do you think of the current slate of punk bands that have sprung up over the last decade?\nSD: I think punk is such a huge umbrella now. And fair play to bands like Green Day and stuff, you know, they've been inspired when they were really young by us and the Clash and things, but it comes from a different well. When we started, punk to me was the Clash, the Pistols, and the Buzzcocks over here, and in the States it was the Dolls, Iggy, and the Ramones. We invented our style, just like the Clash did and the Ramones did. But the bands that have come later, some of them you see tend to just ape what went on before, where I'd rather them do their own thing a bit more with it.\nPitchfork: It has to be a double-edged sword, because I imagine you're proud that so many bands over the past 30 years have been inspired by your songs.\nSD: Yeah, we've had all kinds of people at our gigs, from REM and U2 and stuff, the Pearl Jam guys, to Kurt Cobain and Nirvana. It's a massive compliment, I never thought when we started out we'd be inspiring people like them.\nI mean, I was with Kurt in the weeks before he died. I couldn't believe it, he said to me he loved \"Harmony in My Head\", you know? And I told him that I smoked 20 cigarettes to get that sound because I'd read that John Lennon smoked a load of cigarettes on \"Twist and Shout\". And Kurt loved that.\nPitchfork: Wow, so you were with Kurt right at the end?\nSD: Yeah, we did that last tour with them.\nPitchfork: What was he like to be around during that time?\nSD: He was a nice guy. He said, \"Will you come and play Europe with us, we're doing all these stadiums?\" So we did Portugal and France and Spain and everything. It was like the last 11 days or so, and he was kind of okay. But it was weird, there was about 50 people working for them, all these people putting up lights and computers and everything.\nAnd it was cool on that tour, but there was no Courtney on that tour, you know? So we hung out, and he was very humble. There's some personal things I can't tell you-- what he told me-- but I got on really well with him. It was kind of nice when we sat there on the bus having a few chats. I still owe him two grams of cocaine!\nPitchfork: Oh yeah?! Do you want to elaborate on that?\nSD: Well the first day, I went to his bus, knocked on the door, got on, and he said, \"Do you want to take it with you?\" I said, \"I'll do it with you guys!\" So I emptied the wrap, he went upstairs in the bus, I chopped it all out, none of the band wanted any. So I said to Dave Grohl, \"Do you want some?\" No! So I did a line. Pat Smear? No! The roadie? No! So I did it all, and when Kurt came down I forgot about him! He said, \"What happened to that coke man?!\" I said, \"Shit, I've done the whole fucking lot, nobody wanted any down here, I forgot about you Kurt!\" So when I get up there to heaven or hell, wherever he is, I'll have a couple of grams in my coffin to give to him. God bless him.\nPitchfork: Looking back on it now, was there was any indication that he was disturbed enough to take his life?\nSD: He'd go up and down a bit, depending on how many drugs he took. I guess if he was on heroin and stuff he might be a bit troubled the next day, but generally he was okay, you know? When we left them in France, they went to Rome the next day, and he said, \"I'll see you in Brixton.\" And of course he tried to kill himself in Rome, and then he flew out the next day, back to Seattle and [the next month] he shot himself. I thought, \"I've just left the guy, and he shot himself...\"\nPitchfork: Speaking of mortality, punk has also suffered it's own share of major casualties lately-- with Joe Strummer, and Joey, Johnny and Dee Dee Ramone. How does it feel to be one of the last original punk bands still going?\nSD: It is kind of weird being the last gang in town. I mean, who knows, the Clash may have reformed, but poor old Joe...And of course the Pistols don't really get together much, and the Ramones are not here anymore. We're the sole survivors. When we first started, it was a three-week project to support the Pistols, and we didn't know what we'd be doing after that. We thought if we got a few more gigs then we'd be doing a bit of music and making our point. But I didn't in my wildest dreams think we'd be doing it all these years. It has been a full way of life for me, and for Pete.\nPitchfork: So now the ultimate question is, 30 years after it came to life, has punk accomplished anything near what you hoped it would have when you first joined the Buzzcocks?\nSD: A lot of people [in the U.S.] used to say punk really didn't change anything, but I think it did. It was an intangible thing, not a visible thing. It took us through to a new phase of music and a way of seeing things. It took me a long time to come to that, because at first I thought nothing's really changed. The sky's still blue and all that kind of thing, but I think within people it has left something in their souls. Many of that initial audience are in key positions now in life, and the way they do things has been inspired by punk. When I've met people that work in any walk of life they say, \"If it wasn't for punk I wouldn't be doing it this way.\" I think spiritually, it did change the world a lot.\nPitchfork: Is there any way to quantify what punk has meant to you?\nSD: It's given me strength not to be frightened of things in the world, you know? Punk gave me the strength to think, \"Yeah, you can stand up and be counted, and do what you want in life, and not be hoodwinked by it all,\" in a simple, very general sweeping way. It gives you a sense to question things, and be positive, and open up. And that's what it's done for me, to realize you don't have to worry about people in power in society-- in terms of how they can pressurize you and steer you in ways. It's made me fearless.\nPitchfork: And does that still hold true in 2006?\nSD: I mean, if you go in a cake shop over here, they have a certificate to say somebody can sell you a cake, you know?! It's like, that mindset over people still exists everywhere you go. And it's music that opens your mind to questioning stuff like that, it's not just simply entertainment-- and I think it does with a lot of the audience that listens to it.\nI have a lot of chats with the people in the audience after shows-- many people come to talk about their lives-- it's like they have their own Buzzcocks world. That's what's really inspiring about our music, and in the end, I'd love to think that if there's one thing about us as a band, we've been very inspirational to ourselves, and our audience, and to other bands.",

His production credits for acts like U2 and Snow Patrol display a penchant for self-serious adult-contemporary rock; like the nu-metal mashups of Missy Elliott and Eminem that brought him notoriety around the turn of the century, his solo music has aimed for far lower stakes, looping trite lyrics (“I like it/I like it, yeah”; “I really love it and it’s making me money”) over uninspired big beat. On The Jacknife Lee, the Irish producer shows us a third way, taking ideas he had deemed “too odd” for other projects and realizing them with the help of a diverse, international group of artists. The results feel like a release of pent-up energy after years of melancholy modern-rock production.\nA world away from his Kasabian and Two Door Cinema Club commissions, The Jacknife Lee trades modern rock for a melange of rap, R&B, alt rock, dance punk, and global pop. Most of Lee’s guests here are far less famous than the artists he typically works with. Ghanaian-Australian singer Genesis Owusu’s voice shape-shifts over rumbling bass on opener “Flutter”; on “Hit the Bell,” Toronto rapper Haviah Mighty punctuates an ethereal melody sung by Merge signee Sneaks. All the songs feel like genuine partnerships in which Lee provides a lavish framework for other artists to excel.\nLee does best when he leaves his comfort zone to create something completely new alongside his guests. Muthoni Drummer Queen commands “Sisa Wabaya,” in which the Kenyan rapper’s bilingual boasting (the title translates as “We are the bad ones” in Swahili) is accentuated by clipped bass and overdriven percussion. “Firewalls,” with Petite Noir, is constantly shifting, trading slow-burning atmospheres for stranger elements—guttural vocal samples, filtered breakbeats. There’s a winning sense of restlessness to these productions, as though Lee were always on the search for a new noise to insert, another genre to reference.\nThe higher profile the artists, the more predictable (and consequently, weaker) the songs often are. Aloe Blacc feels out of place, and his lovelorn “I Gave You Everything” doesn’t match the innovative qualities of the rest of the album. “Made It Weird” marks swaggering new territory for Open Mike Eagle, but he’s written more compelling anxiety-focused songs before. And a handful of songs are too slick for the mood they’re trying to convey. The defiant lyrics of “I’m Getting Tired” lose some of their power over a backing track—already too similar to Lee’s big-beat solo work—that previously served as Apple keynote background music.\nThe Jacknife Lee improves in proportion to its risk. Veteran adult-alternative acts don’t often have it in them to be as eccentric as Lee can be here, no matter how ambitious they get. There are fans to please, radio singles to push, Grey’s Anatomy syncs to land. But, guided by his long-standing instinct for combining disparate elements, Lee has found new freedom in letting other voices have the spotlight.\nBuy: Rough Trade\n(Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)\nCatch up every Saturday with 10 of our best-reviewed albums of the week.
