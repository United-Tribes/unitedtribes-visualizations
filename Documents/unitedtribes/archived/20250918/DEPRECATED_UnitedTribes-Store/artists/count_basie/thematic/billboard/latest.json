But he also recorded full-length albums in that era with two certified jazz legends — Count Basie and Duke Ellington. UMe, in conjunction with Frank Sinatra Enterprises, is releasing a double-vinyl collection entitled The Giants of Jazz, out Sept. 26.\nThe release consists of a pair of albums — It Might as Well Be Swing with Basie and His Orchestra, and Francis A. & Edward K. with Ellington — newly remastered from the archival recordings. The package includes a new gatefold jacket design that incorporates rare photographs as well as the original artwork.\nTrending on Billboard\nIt Might as Well Be Swing was released in August 1964, at the height of Beatlemania. It saw Sinatra accompanied by Basie and his orchestra on 10 tracks, including “The Best Is Yet to Come” and what many consider to be the definitive recording of “Fly Me to the Moon (In Other Words).” The latter track has eclipsed 766 million Spotify streams. This was Sinatra’s first studio album arranged by legend-to-be Quincy Jones, who was then just 31.\nIt Might as Well Be Swing was the second Sinatra/Basie collab, following Sinatra-Basie, which reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200 in 1963. It Might as Well Be Swing reached No. 13 in 1964. The two titans teamed a third time in 1966 for the classic live album Sinatra at the Sands, which reached No. 9.\nIt Might as Well Be Swing also included the Oscar-nominated song “More,” which was a standard of the era; “Hello, Dolly,” the Grammy winner for song of the year in 1965; and three Grammy nominees for song of the year – “I Wanna Be Around,” “The Good Life” and “Wives and Lovers.”\nThe title It Might as Well Be Swing was a play on the title of an Oscar-winning song from 1945, “It Might as Well Be Spring” written by Rodgers & Hammerstein. The original cover of It Might as Well Be Swing bears the phrase “A Meeting of Giants,” which provided the title for this reissue.\nFrancis A. & Edward K. was first released in January 1968, uniting Sinatra with Ellington and his big band. The title is a play on their full names – Francis Albert Sinatra and Edward Kennedy Ellington.\n“Indian Summer,” from the album, includes a solo by saxophonist Johnny Hodges. Jazz legends Cootie Williams, Cat Anderson, Paul Gonsalves, Russell Procope, and others are also part of the Ellington orchestra. Long time Sinatra arranger Billy May wrote the arrangements for the album.\nAll three principal artists received lifetime achievement awards from the Recording Academy. Sinatra and Ellington were just the second and third artists to receive that accolade, in 1965 and 1966, respectively, following Bing Crosby. Basie received the honor posthumously in 2002. Ellington, warmly saluted in the title of Stevie Wonder’s smash “Sir Duke,” died in 1974. Basie died in 1984; Sinatra in 1998.\nSinatra has amassed 33 top 10 albums on the Billboard 200, from Songs for Swingin’ Lovers! in April 1956 to Ultimate Christmas in January 2025. That’s one of the three highest totals of top 10 albums by any artist in the history of the chart (which originated on a regular, weekly basis in March 1956). The Rolling Stones lead with 38 top 10 albums, followed by Barbra Streisand with 34. The Beatles are in fourth place with with 32.\nThe collection is now available for pre-order via the Official Store. The release continues a series of reissues of Sinatra music. First up, a special 4-inch Tiny Vinyl Edition of “Jingle Bells/Silent Night” hits shelves on Sept. 12.\nHere are the full tracklistings for the two original albums.\nIt Might as Well Be Swing\n- “Fly Me to the Moon (In Other Words)”\n- “I Wish You Love”\n- “I Believe in You”\n- “More (Theme From Mondo Cane)”\n- “I Can’t Stop Loving You”\n- “Hello, Dolly!
