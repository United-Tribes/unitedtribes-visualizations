    "full_article": "Timothy Zachery Mosley (born March 10, 1972), known professionally as Timbaland, is an American songwriter and record producer. Born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia, he is widely acclaimed for his distinctive production work and \"stuttering\" rhythmic style. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly stated that \"just about every current pop trend can be traced back to him—from sultry, urban-edged R&B songstresses [...] to the art of incorporating avant-garde sounds into No. 1 hits.\" He has won four Grammy Awards from 22 nominations.\nTimbaland's first major production credit was on the album Ginuwine... the Bachelor (1996) by R&B singer Ginuwine.

He performed as a recording artist himself while doing so, releasing three albums as part of the Virginia-based hip-hop duo Timbaland & Magoo, along with his debut solo album, Tim's Bio (1998). He produced Justin Timberlake's 2002 single \"Cry Me a River\", and thereafter produced the majority of Timberlake's subsequent releases—including FutureSex/LoveSounds...",

  "wikipedia_summary": "Timothy Zachery Mosley (born March 10, 1972), known professionally as Timbaland, is an American songwriter and record producer. Born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia, he is widely acclaimed for his distinctive production work and \"stuttering\" rhythmic style. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly stated that \"just about every current pop trend can be traced back to him—from sultry, urban-edged R&B songstresses [...] to the art of incorporating avant-garde sounds into No. 1 hits.\" He has won four Grammy Awards from 22 nominations.\nTimbaland's first major production credit was on the album Ginuwine... the Bachelor (1996) by R&B singer Ginuwine. Further commercial success on his following productions—including Aaliyah's album One in a Million (1996) and Missy Elliott's album Supa Dupa Fly (1997)—made him a sought-after producer for R&B and hip-hop acts. He performed as a recording artist himself while doing so, releasing three albums as part of the Virginia-based hip-hop duo Timbaland & Magoo, along with his debut solo album, Tim's Bio (1998). He produced Justin Timberlake's 2002 single \"Cry Me a River\", and thereafter produced the majority of Timberlake's subsequent releases—including FutureSex/LoveSounds...",
