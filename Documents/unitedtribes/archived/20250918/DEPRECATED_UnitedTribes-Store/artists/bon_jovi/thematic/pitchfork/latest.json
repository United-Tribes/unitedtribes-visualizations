Christian Marclay, “Six New Animations” (Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco, through June 28; also at Les Rencontres de la Photographie, Arles, France, July 4-September 25) Marclay, a visual artist who for years worked with musical themes, had a blockbuster in 2010 with his 24-hour video The Clock, a compendium of movie clips where each one showed what time it was in the scene, which was, as you watched in a museum theater, precisely the time your own watch would have told: if it was 2:43 p.m. for you, the woman on the screen fleeing a stalker was passing below a clock that read 2:43 p.m. Marclay’s new work is back down to the scale of the reconstructed album covers and broken LPs he started with. He took his camera out on the streets of his East London neighborhood and photographed what he found on the ground, edited the pictures into sequences, and then speeded them up. The result, a series of short loops that move so quickly you can’t tell when they end or begin, is something like a video flip-book of litter, or maybe what’s left after the end of the world.\nCigarettes comes across as if discarded butts are not only the detritus but the mind of civilization. As the tiny white nubs rush by, you feel each one as a thing in itself; as the texture and color of the sidewalk or the pavement changes in tiny fractions of a second, as each cigarette seems to light the next, you feel the totality. It’s sickening, it’s irresistible; it’s a critique of capitalism, a comment on addiction, and several million people trying to figure out what to do tonight. There is Bottle Caps, Straws, Chewing Gum, and Cotton Buds—for cleaning crystal meth pipes. The most evocative, the most like a diffusion of modern art into real life, into time and money, Malevich into functional objects, is Lids and Straws, a one-minute loop of Starbucks plastic. You just stare at it, as the litter reassembles itself into a statement about balance, affinity, replication, equality—or none of that, merely things insisting that functionality is art, and beautiful, too. “After The Clock,” Marclay said at the gallery one afternoon, looking at Lids and Straws, “people were always asking, ‘What’s the new Clock going to be?’ Well, here it is. These are all drugs—caffeine, sugar, cigarettes—the stimulants we need to live in the city.” A visitor asked Marclay why, unlike so much of his earlier work, there was no musical element. “There’s rhythm,” Marclay said. “So it’s very abstract,” the visitor said. “It’s not abstract,” Marclay said. “This is everyday life. This is the life beneath our feet.”\n2. Jon Bon Jovi, “Turn Back Time,” DirecTV commercial (Grey Group) Really, this will live forever: what sounds like a very good Bon Jovi song, but in fact a number dreamed up for the ad, strummed and sung soulfully by an impossibly handsome blonde-grey Jon Bon Jovi, standing behind a couch where a husband and wife sit in front of their TV bereft over the fact that they missed their favorite show. But now DirecTV can give them the irresistibly rhythmic POWER TO TURN BACK TIME! and watch it, while Jon reserves for himself the power to completely upend their lives, first disappearing their irritating second child as if he’d never been born and in a second installment bringing back the guy the wife had a thing for before her husband came into the picture—all while Bon Jovi offers the smallest, most devious smile, promising us that he’s just getting started. It could be the best new series of the year.\n3. The Lobster, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, written by Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou (Element Pictures/A24) Funny before Rachel Weisz shows up, not afterward, with Olivia Colman as the boss of a facility that calls up the boarding school in Never Let Me Go and Léa Seydoux as a puritanical cult leader, this movie doubles down on Invasion of the Body Snatchers so relentlessly that when it was over I wasn’t sure I still had a personality.\n4. Don DeLillo, Zero K (Scribner) Speaking of Invasion of the Body Snatchers—somewhere in the general vicinity of Uzbekistan, DeLillo sets a compound where billionaires go to bet on living forever. The tone is that of Todd Haynes’ movie Safe: measured, calm, with hysteria in every reassuring word. It’s scary, but not so much as a scene where the narrator sees a woman standing on a New York street, “arms bent above her head, fingers not quite touching,” a “fixed point in the nonstop swarm,” a prophet of some kind, but without words or signs to say what’s coming, and absolutely nothing passing between the two of them: “I watched her, knowing that I could not invent a single detail of the life that pulsed behind those eyes.”\n5. Thalia Zedek Band, “Afloat,” from Eve (Thrill Jockey) Through Live Skull, through Come, Zedek’s guitar always bore weight—you could feel the whole 20th century catastrophe bearing down on it. That weight is still there, as through a long instrumental introduction—enveloping, full of confidence, elegiac—you find yourself at a funeral for someone you’ve never met. With Hilken Mancini coming in as a second vocal behind Zedek’s lead, there’s a sense of looking back, from a long time ago—or a sense of someone imagining looking back, because that means they didn’t go down in the flood the song describes. Lyric clichés float on the song—“the rains come down,” “rivers rise,” “higher ground”—until a line makes its way out that is not a cliché: “What we left behind, someone else will find.” This could play next to Geeshie Wiley’s “Last Kind Words Blues”—the exit is that final.\n6. and 7. Jonathan Weisman, “The Nazi Tweets of ‘Trump God Emperor’,” (The New York Times, May 26) and Yamiche Alcindor, “Die-Hard Bernie Sanders Backers See F.B.I. as Answer to Their Prayers,” (The New York Times, May 27) Weisman tweeted “an essay by Robert Kagan on the emergence of fascism in the United States,” and the result, keyed by Weisman’s last name, was an avalanche: “Trump God Emperor sent me the Nazi iconography of the shiftless, hooknosed Jew. I was served an image of the gates of Auschwitz, the famous words ‘Arbeit Macht Frei’ replaced without irony with ‘Machen Amerika Great.’” That was just the start. “‘I found the Menorah you were looking for,’” another Trump celebrant tweeted: “it was a candelabrum made of the number six million.” “I am not the first Jewish journalist to experience the onslaught,” Weisman wrote. “Julia Ioffe was served up on social media in concentration camp garb and worse after Trump supporters took umbrage with her profile of Melania Trump in GQ magazine. The would-be first lady later told an interviewer that Ms. Ioffe had provoked it. The anti-Semitic hate hurled at the conservative commentator Bethany Mandel prompted her to buy a gun.” But in its way, Yamiche Alcindor’s straight report on a Bernie Sanders rally was just as bad. “Victor Vizcarra, 48, of Los Angeles, said he would much prefer Mr. Trump to Mrs. Clinton,” Alcindor wrote. “Though he said he disagreed with some of Mr. Trump’s policies, he added that he had watched ‘The Apprentice’ and expected that a Trump presidency would be more exciting than a ‘boring’ Clinton administration.\n“‘A dark side of me wants to see what happens if Trump is in,’ said Mr. Vizcarra, who works in information technology,” Alcindor went on. “‘There is going to be some kind of change, and even if it’s like a Nazi-type change, people are so drama-filled. They want to see stuff like that happen. It’s like reality TV. You don’t want to just see everybody be happy with each other. You want to see someone fighting somebody.’”\nIn between these two news stories are two broader stories that go to the heart of contemporary life. As the radical sociologist Georges Bataille wrote in “The Notion of Expenditure” in 1933, any society can find itself drawn irrevocably to actions “with no end beyond themselves,” to a game of life in which one gambles not to win but to lose, to create “catastrophes that, while conforming to well-defined needs, provoke tumultuous depressions, crises of dread and, in the final analysis, a certain orgiastic state.” That is, the other side of fascism is nihilism, and citizens like Victor Vizcarra speak for a deep desire, shared by millions, not to change America but to blow it up, to be rid forever of the oppressions of liberty, justice, equality, fairness, and democracy—and that includes self-described so-called progressives who would never admit that anyone like Victor Vizcarra could speak for them. And the other side of that story is the incomprehension on the part of so many professional rationalists as to what politics is: an argument about the good.\nFascists and nihilists don’t care about contradictions—all they want is someone to smash people not like them. Liberal commentators tut-tutting over the not-rich voting-against-their-own-interests could not be more obtuse in their blinkered idea of what politics is about and what it’s for: one’s own interest isn’t merely a matter of who will put more dollars in your pocket. It’s a decision about what kind of country you want to live in, and how you can be permitted to define yourself. People aren’t stupid, and their votes aren’t bought. Independence Day: Resurgence opens this month; you can see America destroyed before it gets saved. Those who want a more gratifying ending, that orgiastic state, can stay home, save their money, turn on the news, and root.\n8. Small Glories, Wondrous Traveler (MFM) From Winnipeg: Cara Luft plays banjo, JD Edwards plays guitar, and in moments they find the darkening chord change the best bluegrass—from the Stanley Brothers to Be Good Tanyas—has always hidden in the sweet slide of the rhythm, the tiny shift where the person telling the story suddenly understands it.\n9. Laura Oldfield Ford, Hermes Chthonius (SoundCloud) and as part of the exhibition “Chthonic Reverb” (Grand Union Gallery, Birmingham, UK, June 17-August 5) Ford, born in West Yorkshire in 1973, who from 2005 to 2009 published the zine Savage Messiah, a street walking excavation of the ruins of present-day London—it was collected in 2011 by Verso—has never accepted stable time. The past is always present, but it isn’t history: it’s a promise just over the horizon, or a hand in a horror movie pulling you down. In this 36-minute soundwork, she’s traversing Birmingham, looking for “the psychic contours of a city,” speaking quietly into a tape recorder, traffic humming around her, sometimes the noise of crowds or small groups of people, pop songs occasionally mixed in, and you are following the trail of a woman who seems to remember 1974 as if she were her own aunt, the one the rest of the family never talked about, so that when she says 2016 it barely feels real. “You keep finding the embers,” she says, with previous allusions to IRA bombings and urban riots as a rolling backdrop: “Places you must have seen from car windows 23 years ago.”\nThere is the building that once housed the Birmingham Press Club: “They used to have the upstairs, a litany of names, they’ve all been here, Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher, Enoch Powell, Barbara Cartland, Earl Spencer, Cliff Richard—it’s all too much,” she says of the specter of bland power, of seeing herself on the same stairs, in their footsteps. “This is where it was all concocted”—a conspiracy of government officials, pop stars, romance novelists—“in those rooms upstairs.”\nShe looks at graffiti on a pub: “A refusal to accept what England has become, they hover above the walls as a negative ambiance,” a gateway “into those undercurrents of excess, violence, destruction for its own sake. You’ve tuned into the undercurrent that speaks of refusal, a hatred of doing the right thing.” It’s a civil war of the dead, people turning into specters as she passes them, as she does to them. At the very end you hear Rod Stewart, with “You Wear It Well,” from 1972, the sound rickety and distant, as if you’re listening not to a record but to the woman you’ve been listening to remembering what it was to hear him sing it at a show she attended before she was born, and it’s never sounded more true.\nLaura Oldfield Ford: Hermes Chthonius (via SoundCloud)\n10. Marlene Marder, 1954-2016 The first single by Kleenex, a punk band from Zurich, appeared in 1978; their second album, and their last, after Kimberly Clark complained and they changed their name to Liliput, came out in 1983. Across those mere five years their music was made of glee and dread, playground chants back-flipping into songs about rape; there was nothing like it before and there’s been nothing like it since. Marlene Marder was the guitarist: she could go from the primitive to the grand and back again without turning her head. She died of cancer in Zurich on May 15; just a month before, She Shreds magazine, celebrating its 10th anniversary, reprised an interview with Marder from its second issue, from just four years ago, and its ending says as much about why good punk records, regardless of when they were made, always sound like the first word, never the last. “What is your favorite setup now?” asked Kana Harris. “It is still my Fender Strat with Marshall MS-4,” Marder said. “You’ve also been an activist for environmental protection, going to college for it and working for the World Wildlife Fund,” Harris said. “Do you feel your music is inspired by activism?” “I guess our music was inspired by that time, maybe activism, too, art and DIY,” said Marder. “We didn’t think much in such terms, we just played. We never ever had the idea that our music would last this long.” “What did you learn from playing in a band that you were able to take with you into this career?” Harris asked finally. “I learned that everything is possible,” Marder said. She would have said it plainly, as if it were never in doubt; that’s the woman I knew.",

So have a good look at the triumphs and heartbreaks, the reunions and breakups, and the humanity, insanity, and inanity that colored the great tapestry of music in 2006.\nAnd if you missed Part 1, catch up here .\nJULY\nOn July 7, the world lost a visionary, as founding Pink Floyd singer/guitarist/songwriter and notorious recluse Syd Barrett passed away in peace at his Cambridgeshire home. He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer for less than a month before passing away. The Piper's at the gates of heaven now.\nA highlight of 2005's Pitchfork-curated Intonation Festival-- and probably the only band with a cello I've ever danced to-- !!! offshoot Out Hud unexpectedly called it quits , with cellist Molly Schnick revealing, \"There are clues about [the breakup] all over the last record.\" Cryptic!\nHARRY POTTER TO WYRD SISTERS:\nFUCK YOU, PAY ME\nMix Jarvis Cocker, Harry Potter, two members of Radiohead, and some pissed-off Canadians in a magical flaming cauldron of litigation-- and presto! One of 2006's most bizarre stories, and one of the year's best headlines .\nVICTORIA BERGSMAN LEAVES THE CONCRETES\nFollowing a series of setbacks for Swedish indie-poppers the Concretes-- including yet another incident of gear theft and a cancelled tour -- lead vocalist Victoria Bergsman took her uncanny ability to pout with pulchritude and left the band to pursue a solo project called Taken by Trees.\nCHILDREN FIGHT HIP-HOP WITH POWER OF SUFJAN\nKids these days are growing up so fast! While you were all hung up on Raffi in elementary school, a Maryland-based group of today's youngsters calling themselves the Rapper's Delight Club-- with a little help from a savvy teacher-- wrote, rapped, and recorded a bunch of cute rhymes over a Sufjan Stevens sample . By this time next year they'll be listening to NPR and grumbling about their 401(k)s.\nPITCHFORK MUSIC FESTIVAL WAS SO AWESOME\nAnd the month closed out with a scorcher, as the inaugural Pitchfork Music Festival brought tens of thousands of music-lovers out to Chicago's Union Park for two literally and figuratively hot days of rock and mayhem.\nTropicália icons Os Mutantes provided the fest's grand finale with one of only a handful of reunion gigs, Ted Leo had an ugly collision with a blood-thirsty microphone, and Bonde do Role's Marina Ribatski dislocated a bone while crowdsurfing-- and, after a swift recovery, auctioned her X-rays on eBay .\nAll said, a ridiculously great time.\nAUGUST\nDAMON ALBARN FORMS YET ANOTHER BAND\nIn one fell swoop, Damon Albarn found both another excuse to ditch the other guys in Blur and a band name that, defying the physics of nomenclature, is actually worse than Gorillaz. The Good, the Bad and the Queen brought together Albarn and former members of the Clash, the Verve, and Fela Kuti's band, making it a bona fide supergroup, and necessitating an ugly acronym we'd rather didn't exist. Later they streamed stuff from their Danger Mouse-produced debut LP, which is now due in January.\nEX-LIFETIME BASSIST ARRESTED FOR HOARDING HUMAN BODY PARTS\nLinda Kay, best known as an ex-bassist for recently reactivated hardcore punks Lifetime, but now an \"exotic dancer,\" was arrested for hoarding human body parts in her basement : six skulls, to be exact, and a human hand she kept in a jar of formeldehyde and called \"Freddy.\" If convicted, could she face a lifetime sentence??\nDEATH FROM ABOVE 1979 SPLIT UP\nAnother Pitchfork pick for the 2005 Intonation Festival called it quits (does this qualify as a curse?): Canadian bass'n'drums duo Death From Above 1979. In an eloquent MySpace valediction, bassist Jesse F. Keeler called the split \"a totally normal function of growing up.\" Plus, having to tack that shitty \"1979\" onto the end of their bandname was a real kick in the pants.\nLOVE'S ARTHUR LEE DEAD OF LEUKEMIA AT 61\nAnother visionary headed toward the light: Love's Arthur Lee succumbed to leukemia on August 3 in a Memphis hospital, with his wife at his side. Wrote his manager, Mark Finn, in eulogy: \"Most of all I'll miss Arthur playing Arthur's music.\" Sad!\nOXES SUE OLD NAVY OVER T-SHIRT DESIGN\nOld Navy incurred the lawsuit wrath of Baltimore math rock trio Oxes after mass-producing and selling a t-shirt bearing an image of an Oxes concert flyer-- and kinda sorta forgetting to, er, ask the band about it first.\nYou dared to ask what happens when the blackest of black metal meets Pink , and Sunn O))) and Boris dared to answer with the collaborative Southern Lord LP Altar . Now you're the one collecting skulls in your basement.\nSHOCKING EXPOSÉ REVEALS UGLY TRUTH ABOUT TAPES N' TAPES\nThanks to the humor and imagination of comedian and Pitchfork pre-party laugh-elicter Aziz Ansari, the world finally found out why we love Tapes 'n Tapes so damn much . It's not a derivit!\nINTERPOL SIGN TO CAPITOL RECORDS\nAfter a long and fruitful relationship with Matador Records, Interpol left the indie circuit to try its luck with the major leagues: Capitol Records. In the band's defense, Cosloy always was a bit stingy with the manicures.\nJust 30 minutes (or about the length of one song) into their set at Seattle's Endfest, The Mars Volta were attacked by dastardly concertgoers... with actual piss!\nCedric Bixler-Zavala left the stage stating, \"I will pay $100-1,000 to somebody to find the person that's throwing urine up here... Find that person and kick his ass for me. Bring me his head. And we'll be friends!\" Mars Volta hecklers, urincorrigible!\nWHITE STRIPES APPEAR ON \"THE SIMPSONS\"\nWhen our kids are all 24, this will basically be like that time Mama Cass was on Scooby-Doo. (And Sonic Youth, their Jonathan Winters!) But for at least one brief, fun-filled half hour, it seemed like news to us .\nOUTBACK STEAKHOUSE TENDERIZES OF MONTREAL\nHundreds of scrawny Williamsburg vegans considered giving up their dreary meat-free lifestyles for almost 30 seconds, as a \"beefed\"-up version of Of Montreal's \"Wraith Pinned to the Mist (And Other Games)\" appeared in a commercial for Outback Steakhouse -- with an all-new set of lyrics.\nSEPTEMBER\nVenerable Chicago label Touch & Go-- who've put out more worthwhile records over the years than we can count ( although we tried )-- celebrated the big 2-5 with a massive, three-day birthday bash at the city's Hideout Block Party.\nOnboard for the momentous occasion: current label stalwarts like Pinback, Black Heart Procession, and CocoRosie, and tons of choice reunions, including Negative Approach, Girls Against Boys, Man or Astroman?, a still-ferocious Scratch Acid, and, for a four-song tease, Big Black.\nTeaming with subversive UK graffiti assassin Banksy, Danger Mouse helped make a good 500 UK moms shriek in horror-- and further tarnished the innocence of 500 teenage girls and middle-aged perverts-- planting doctored copies of Paris Hilton's CD with the sleazy socialite's top falling off, a dog's head photoshopped onto her body, and reworked song titles like \"Why Am I Famous?\" and \"What Am I For?\" in shops across the UK. Hilton retaliated by filming herself having dispassionate sex and subjecting the entire internet to the results.\nMopey Scots Arab Strap hung up the kilts (sorry, couldn't resist) for good, after 10 solid years of filling out all our breakup mixtapes. They bowed out with a final tour and the best-of collection Ten Years of Tears! , released in late October.\nAfter 10 glorious years of releasing top-notch dance and electronic music from the likes of LCD Soundsystem, Four Tet, Mu, the Rapture, and more, Trevor Jackon's Output Recordings closed up shop for good .\n\"I never wanted to have all my passion and enthusiasm knocked out of me,\" wrote Jackson in a sad and revealing statement. \"But somehow it's happened.\"\nThanks to a good dressing-down on \"All My Children\", we learned that contrary to what our peers have led us to believe, Mike Patton is not God . And, furthermore, that listening to the Peeping Tom album is actually less soul-crushing than watching soap stars try to act.\nJAY-Z MAKES FIRST QUESTIONABLE BUSINESS DECISION EVER\nAfter months of speculation , the Greatest Rapper Alive officially ended his retirement , subsequently driving home the widely held belief that few things are quite so boring as listening to middle-aged billionaire moguls complain about hardship.\nMISSION OF BURMA GET BUTT NAKED\nMission of Burma guitarist Roger Miller may have written thousands of words for his Pitchfork exclusive tour diary , but it's the thousand words evoked by this tantalizing image that still haunt us to this day.\nSUGARCUBES REUNITE FOR LABEL BENEFIT\nIcelandic pop auteurs the Sugarcubes, featuring the one and only Björk, announced plans to reunite for one November record label benefit/20th bjirthday gig in Reykjavik.\n\" We're just having fun together and enjoying each other's company ,\" Sugarcube Einar Örn later told Pitchfork.\nPhotographer Leó Stefánsson was onhand for the celebration and scored us some dazzling pictures .\nBONNIE \"PRINCE\" BILLY GOT WEIRDER\nBonnie \"Prince\" Billy found a friend and promising castle party-planner in, of all people, Andrew WK -- who backed up Billy on \"Late Night With Conan O'Brien\" (photo courtesy of Drag City)-- and a court jester in comedian Neil Hamburger, with whom he paired for a series of cracked-out commercials promoting Bonnie's 2006 LP, The Letting Go .\nPerhaps inspired by his sordid dealings with Hamburger, Bonnie P. later decided to take up stand-up comedy . The gig, at Chicago's Weeds club, doesn't go down until December 19-- but we're laughing already.\n\"MUSIC EXPERT\" ZAK SALLY GOES PUBLIC WITH LOVE OF TOOL\nEx-Low bassist and graphic artist/book publisher Zak Sally discussed the merits of his favorite rock band, Tool, on ABC News . You know, the one your parents and 22 million other Americans watch every night.\nHe later chatted with Pitchfork , claiming he was as shocked as the rest of us. \"The whole thing was a surprise to me. It was absurd in a good way.\"\nRyan! Adams! Come! On! Our boy wonder discovered the internet this year, and nothing will ever be the same again . Although we have to admit, he does bust mad flavor.\nJENNY LEWIS GETS DISSED BY TOO $HORT\nJenny Lewis might be the stuff of dreams for pretty much every indie boy in this land (indie girls, too), but as she revealed in an interview with Pitchfork, she's still not good enough for Too $hort .\nOCTOBER\nWithout a Sleater-Kinney to go home to, supreme drummer Janet Weiss ran off with Stephen Malkmus' Jicks, officially joining the band . As she told The Portland Mercury , \"What self-respecting musician wouldn't jump at the chance to play with one of the staggering guitarists of our generation?!\"\nKILL ROCK STARS FOUNDER LEAVES FOR A&R\nIn a totally unexpected move, Slim Moon-- a name synonymous with indie goodness-- left Kill Rock Stars , the label he founded and ran for 15 years, for the greener pastures of Nonesuch.\n\"I haven't been unhappy or anything,\" he told Pitchfork. \"I just really want to push myself to a whole new frontier.\"\nMoon put KRS in the able hands of his wife and partner, Portia Sabin, while crazy little sibling imprint 5RC subsequently announced plans to fold , leaving our little DIY hearts sighing forlornly.\nWeezer sought some cash for their retirement fund (we hope), suing the Miller Beer Company over a 2004 magazine ad that lumped them in the company of Velvet Revolver, Bon Jovi, Puddle of Mudd, Trapt, and Incubus-- which, now that they mention it, pretty much sounds like the recipe for \"Beverly Hills\".\nWIND-UP FINALLY REISSUES THE WRENS\nThe tumultuous saga of the first two Wrens records finally came to a satisfying, if surprising conclusion, as Wind-Up Records-- who'd kept 1994's Silver and 1996's Secaucus locked up in an iron tower guarded by rogue wizards and sand creatures-- finally reissued both records on November 14.\nWhen the band heard the news, \"our eyes shot out of our heads,\" according to singer/guitarist Charles Bissell. \"We were like 'WHAT?!'\"\nCBGB LAID TO REST\nAll 11th-hour efforts to save CBGB proved futile, as the legendary New York dive closed in October -- and, adding insult to injury, moved to Las Vegas.\nA bunch of quality acts that helped establish the club's legacy were on-hand to play shows during the funeral week, including Patti Smith, Bad Brains, and members of Blondie.\nA legend of a different sort closed up shop: Tower Records, who helped us build our music collections for 46 years, announced plans to liquidate its stock and close all locations following another declaration of bankruptcy.\nRuss Solomon founded Tower in 1960 in Sacramento, and the chain eventually grew to include 89 stores, all of which boldly carried pretty much any record you'd ever want to buy-- assuming money was no object.\nSEBADOH ANNOUNCE PLANS TO REGROUP\nOn a brighter note, hot on the heels of a reissue of classic III , seminal lo-fi rockers Sebadoh announced plans to reunite for a spring 2007 tour featuring the original line-up of Lou Barlow, Eric Gaffney, and Jason Loewenstein.\nWhile we were getting mad psyched for that, Gaffney put out a solo album called Uncharted Waters and Barlow toured it up with the also-reunited Dinosaur Jr. , who have a new disc in the works. Current \"college rock\" acts are shivering in their breeches.\nAnd speaking of dinosaurs, the Stooges announced plans to record a new album-- with bassist Mike Watt replacing the late David Alexander. \"Seems this band is good and practiced,\" wrote Watt in a diary entry on his website. Sounds like this Iggy Pop guy might make something of himself.\nNIKE COMMISSIONS MARATHON LCD SOUNDSYSTEM TRACK\nProving inspired music-making and mega-corporations can-- given the proper conditions-- coexist fruitfully, LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy took some $$$ from Nike and put together the fantastic 45:33 running mix, its title doubling as its duration.\nMurphy later chatted with Pitchfork, marveling over the sound of words on Sound of Silver (LCD's new album, due out in March) and the fact that exercise-types who knew nothing of LCD Soundsystem actually bought 45:33 for running, and some of them even called it \" retarded. \" This just in: regular exercise kills brain cells.\nINDIE ROCK'S WEEK OF BLOODSHED\nSome cursed planets and moons must have lined up or something, because the middle of October was all about rock show violence.\nFirst, Juan Maclean laid the Juan MacSmackdown on some rowdy reveler who messed with his gear at an October 13 gig in Atlanta. Juan and the kid whose ass he kicked later kissed and made up on the DFA message board. Awww!\nThe very same night, a bull-headed cop attempted to break up a Two Gallants show in Houston, got scared, and wound up brawling with the band -- destroying some antique equipment, sending several performers to jail for the night, and Tasering some poor 14-year-old kid with a camera in the process.\n\"It's a sobering feeling to have the law be completely lawless,\" Gallant Adam Stephens later told Pitchfork , \"and feel like there's absolutely nothing I could do.\"\nEven Jeff Tweedy [pictured] got in on the action, decking some goofy fan in Springfield, Missouri who crashed the stage and attempted to kiss the Wilco frontman during a show. Tweedy later explained the outburst , revealing that the stage-crasher actually hopped on someone's wheelchair(!) to get up there and joking, \"I'm quick like a knife; cat-like reflexes.\"\nSCARLETT JOHANSSON THREATENS TOM WAITS COVERS ALBUM\nWith \"Summertime\" now under her belt, filmstar heartthrob Scarlett Johansson decided to take it to the next level , announcing plans to record an album of Tom Waits covers.\n\"I don't know if I'm excited to hear it,\" Waits later told Pitchfork's Amanda Petrusich when asked about the ScarJo covers disc, \"but I'm curious.\"\nPigs flew through a frozen over Hell as Lady Sovereign joined the esteemed ranks of Britney, Christina, and Jessica, topping the \"TRL\" countdown with her video for \"Love Me or Hate Me\". Perhaps there's hope for the nation's touch-tone youngsters after all...\nSov later lent a rendition of Sex Pistols classic \"Pretty Vacant\" to the pretty abysmal \"O.C.\" covers comp.\nThe wily weirdos of Xiu Xiu shared some borderline NSFW Polaroids -- taken with fan-provided film -- with the Pitchfork readership. And once our eyes finally started working again... they shared more.\nJUSTIN HAWKINS QUITS THE DARKNESS\nThis just in: Using and abusing coke still tears bands apart. Take it from Justin Hawkins, who shocked the world when he announced his intent to quit the Darkness and disclosed the ridiculous extent of his coke addiction. While that-- ahem-- blows, rest assured as the Darkness will forge ahead with bassist Richie Edwards taking over vocals. Dude, it worked for Brian Johnson.\nPFM MADE YOU WANT TO SMOKE CRACK\nAnd speaking of substances, the War on Drugs took a surprising turn as it was discovered that marijuana and this so-called \"indie rock\" stuff are in fact connected, perhaps even causally-- and it's CORRUPTING OUR CHILDREN .\nWith indie rock records now forbidden in the majority of American households, the kids have no choice but to gorge on Cheetos and listen to trap -rap and Dad's old Pink Floyd LPs.\nNOVEMBER\nDIRTY THREE INCITE SHANGHAI RIOT\nThey're not exactly the first band we'd expect to inspire their fans to tear da club up, but Australian chamber rock trio Dirty Three did just that in Shanghai, inciting a near riot when Yun Feng Theatre officials attempted to curtail the band's performance to make way for a bunch of acrobats.\n\"Probably one of the most exciting moments I have ever had onstage,\" enthused DT's Warren Ellis to Pitchfork.\nRAINER MARIA BREAK UP\nCatastrophe kept them together, but not for long, alas. Just a few months after the release of fifth LP Catastrophe Keeps Us Together , beloved lit-rock trio Rainer Maria parted ways , leaving a legacy of 11 years of emotive rocking.\n\"For us, this transition can be nothing short of heartbreaking,\" wrote drummer William Kuehn. \"But for reasons both musical and personal, the three of us have chosen this time to move on.\"\nTRAIL OF DEAD'S CONRAD KEELY SPILLS HIS HEART OUT\nIf you see ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead's Conrad Keely anytime soon, give the poor guy a hug . Touring, making records, and, good golly, life in general ain't all it's cracked up to be for the defeated-sounding Keely, as he revealed in a candid interview with Pitchfork.\n\"There's nothing glamorous anymore to what we do,\" said the Trail of Dead frontman.\nKeely later got in an altercation with his guitarist, Kevin Allen, at a gig in Florida. And the band's 2006 set So Divided fell a few notches shy of the 10.0 mark. Can't a guy catch a break?\nKIDS INTERPRET DEERHOOF WITH DANCE\nFinally! Something unequivocally heartwarming: Kids interpretive dancing to Deerhoof! Photos ! Videos ! Joy!\nAs Deerhoof dude John Dieterich later described to Pitchfork, \"Here's 10 kids dressed all in white, jumping up and down and screaming, like, 'Hello Deerhoof!' It was just like, what? What is happening to us?\"\nThe band's Friend Opportunity lands January 23 and should be a hit among moms everywhere.\nSince whoever-it-was has been gone, seems Kelly Clarkson found a new, significantly cooler man : former Minuteman, current Stooge, and Pitchfork BFF Mike Watt.\nWatt recorded some bass parts for Clarkson's forthcoming album, telling Pitchfork, \"I knew nothing of Kelly Clarkson before this but can tell you, in my opinion, that she can sing her ass off. Man, she's got pipes and goes for it.\"\nKelly on Mike: \"I think the old punk guy idea's a good one.\"\nCLIPSE'S HELL HATH NO FURY FINALLY COMES OUT\nWith flaming hip-hop disappointments dropping left and right at the end of the year, we were thrilled (trilled, even) to see Clipse's loooooong-awaited Hell Hath No Fury a) actually come out this year , and b) meet if not exceed the sky-high expectations everyone had for it .\nAfter a whirlwind year that had her atop the \"TRL\" countdown and selling out shows across the country, Lady Sovereign broke down during a November 15 performance in Los Angeles, later telling Pitchfork \" I honestly thought I was going to die. \"\nNow back on her feet and more alive than ever, Sov's set to rock MTV's New Year's bash and get to work on some new tunes, since most of the ones that just came out have been floating around for about 14 years now.\nLES SAVY FAV INTERVIEWS LES SAVY FAV\nIn an exclusive video self-interview they put together for Pitchfork, Les Savy Fav asked themselves the hard-hitting questions about their forthcoming album (due in April), and babies.\nDECEMBER\nVELVET UNDERGROUND ACETATE AUCTION ENDS AT $155K\nMontreal resident Warren Hill must have accrued a shit ton of karma over the last few years, as the man-- who, as it turns out, is also Sunset Rubdown's merch guy -- scored a one-of-a-kind Velvet Underground acetate at a street sale for $0.75...\n...and sold it on eBay for, wait for it...\n$155,401.00\n...to a fake bidder, apparently .\nTHE GO! TEAM PAY THEIR PUBLISHING DUES\nThe Go! Team found themselves in a slightly sticky situation -- after licensing their song \"Huddle Formation\" to a Honda Civic commercial despite previously expressing distaste for such a practice-- but handled it gracefully, explaining their reasons on the Go! Team message board. Best of all: We can expect plenty of samples on the new disc. Hot!\nFLAMING LIPS ALLEY, OKLAHOMA CITY\nThe Flaming Lips left their mark in more comprehensive road atlases everywhere, as the mayor and council of Oklahoma City honored the band-- whose Wayne Coyne still resides in OK City-- with an alley in Bricktown.\n\"It's like some little secret special thing,\" a thrilled Coyne told the AP.\nTHE DECEMBERISTS VS. STEPHEN COLBERT VS. THE PEOPLE\nThe Decemberists inadvertently slighted fake news anchor/funny guy Stephen Colbert, who encouraged viewers of \"The Colbert Report\" to hijack the green screen music video contest put together by the band-- who in turn put a music video and guitar solo counterchallenge before Colbert-- who in turn issued a counter-counterchallenge and accepted the Decemberists' invitation to shred.\nRepping for the Portland outfit, Chris Funk will appear on \"The Colbert Report\" on December 20 to take on Colbert himself, who we hear is a new wave force to be reckoned with. \\m/",

The quasi-urban cultural catchall of Broward County habitually welcomes top-dollar relics like Bon Jovi and Motley Crue without even a wink of big city irony-- we Sunshine Staters are as proud of our past indiscretions as we are trapped by them. Launching their current U.S. tour here, in front of 5,700 sympathetic fans at the plastic-scented Office Depot Center, would no doubt provide the necessary ego jolt to fuel Duran Duran's recently repaired Wayback Machine.\nTeetering on their reunited original lineup and the triumphantly mediocre Astronaut, the band drew a crowd almost indistinguishable, it turned out, from themselves. Forty-something, fit, and fashionable, both the High Life-sipping punters in the floor seats and Le Bon et al sparkled with the same metrosexual (known less poetically in 1985, during the band's last major tour, as \"pretty boy\") sheen. Totally devoid of tight pants, skinny ties, or feathered hairdos, the aesthetic was more store-bought post-yuppie sophisticate than day-glo '80s throwback.\nThe show proceeded exactly like you'd expect a Duran Duran show to proceed. They started by diving into \"Sunrise\", Astronaut's shiny, radio-ready single. Le Bon's voice was strong and his step spunky; he jogged from one wing to the other while guitarist Andy Taylor and bassist John Taylor mostly marched in place. The next 20-some minutes were deliriously full-throttle, capped by a totally radical \"Hungry Like the Wolf.\"\nThen, 70-some minutes of blah blah blah. That is: Airtight, light-as-air synth-pop. Lots of white people dancing. Not much onstage action beyond Le Bon's laps from wing to wing. Occasional vocal duels with backup singer Anna Ross (Diana's sister? She did throw a little \"We Are Family\" into the end of a nearly-funky\"Notorious\"). Cell phones held aloft in lieu of lighters during a syrupy \"Save a Prayer\". Um, more white people dancing.\nWhile songs off Astronaut satisfied, it was of course the interspersed classics that rekindled adolescent urges. \"Reflex\" and \"Wild Boys\" thumped and swished, songs fossilized by context that still sounded fresh despite their sidecar of nostalgia. A lack of choreographed visuals and an underwhelming light display kept the focus mainly on the music, which slid by elegantly, innocuously. The whole display was a rather vivid encapsulation of Duran Duran's career.\nBut an energetic \"White Lines\" as the encore opener was a playful, apropos surprise, and \"Girls on Film\" into \"GrooveIs in the Heart\", with Ross taking over on vocals, put a spike in the crowd's Richter scale. Apparently, though, it was \"Rio\" that we all came to hear, and the band made us wait 'til the finale to get it. Rekindled, reminiscing, we sang along like goony teenagers, painfully aware that it's been 20 years and nobody's getting any younger.",
