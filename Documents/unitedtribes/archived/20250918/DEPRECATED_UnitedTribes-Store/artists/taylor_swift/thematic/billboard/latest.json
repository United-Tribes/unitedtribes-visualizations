Well, during Swift’s appearance last week on the New Heights podcast, hosted by boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason, fans picked up on a few hints — including an extended conversation about baking sourdough bread. Next year’s Super Bowl is at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, home of the San Francisco 49ers, whose mascot happens to be a miner character named Sourdough Sam. If that’s not enough, Swift said she now talks about sourdough “60% of the time” — and next year’s big game happens to be Super Bowl 60.\nOn the new Billboard Pop Shop Podcast, Katie & Keith are laying out all the fan evidence pointing to Swift headlining the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show. If Swift does wind up with the gig, she would be the first halftime headliner to not come from the worlds of R&B or hip-hop since 2020, when Latin pop superstars Shakira and Jennifer Lopez shared the stage.\nTrending on Billboard\nAlso on the show, as Alex Warren’s “Ordinary” returns to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a 10th total week, we’ve now got three KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack songs in the top 10. Plus, on the Billboard 200, Gunna, mgk, Jonas Brothers and BABYMETAL all make waves in the top 10, as Morgan Wallen’s I’m the Problem scores an 11th week at No. 1.\nThe Billboard Pop Shop Podcast is your one-stop shop for all things pop on Billboard‘s weekly charts.

Some have come out of nowhere, others have taken months to catch on, and all of them could become ubiquitous in the blink of a TikTok clip.\nThis week: Taylor Swift’s announcement of her upcoming 12th album leads to streaming gains across her catalog, Cardi B helps a Jay-Z fan favorite find new life, a 20-year-old metal cut goes viral for bizarre reasons and more.\nThe Streams of a Showgirl: Taylor Swift’s Catalog Booms Following Album Announcement\nNot only did Taylor Swift announce her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, last week, but she did so in a way that became a multi-day news cycle — first teasing a new era and appearance on her boyfriend Travis Kelce’s New Heights podcast on Monday (Aug. 10), then revealing later that day that the podcast interview would include plenty of information about her new album, and then unveiling all of the Showgirl details in a wide-ranging discussion on Wednesday (Aug. 12), with those meme-able moments and potential Easter eggs powering Swifties through the end of last week. Although fans will have to wait until Oct. 3 for Swift’s new album, they didn’t have to wait to stream her back catalog, which enjoyed a sizable streaming boost in the midst of the excitement.\nTrending on Billboard\nFrom Aug. 12-14, Swift’s catalog earned nearly 110 million official U.S. on-demand streams, according to Luminate; that total marked a 57% bump from the three-day period right before the New Heights podcast tease (70 million streams from Aug. 8-10). Meanwhile, one Swift song has been resurgent for a non-Showgirl reason: “False God,” from 2019’s Lover, was featured in the Aug. 13 episode of the hit Amazon Prime series The Summer I Turned Pretty. The song earned 1.2 million streams from Aug. 13-15, up a whopping 383% from the previous weekend (250,000 streams). – JASON LIPSHUTZ\nCardi B’s New ‘Imaginary Playerz’ Single Spurs Notable Gains for Jay-Z Gem It References\nCardi B is keeping her Am I the Drama? album campaign rolling, and for her latest single she looked to fellow New York hip-hop icon, Jay-Z. For “Imaginary Playerz,” Cardi sampled Jay’s “Imaginary Players,” a Prestige-produced fan-favorite from 1997’s In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Though Cardi’s track, which dropped on Aug. 15, envisions Jay’s original from a female perspective, her new single still spurred streaming gains for Hov’s classic.\nAccording to Luminate, Cardi’s track pulled over 3.8 million official on-demand U.S. streams in its first four days of release (Aug. 15-18). During that same period, Jay’s “Imaginary Players” earned over 427,000 official streams, marking a whopping 313% increase from the 103,000 official streams it collected the weekend prior (Aug. 8-11).\nJay’s original was never an official single, but the “Imaginary Players” legacy lives on through Cardi’s latest tease of her long-awaited sophomore studio album. — KYLE DENIS\n‘Freaky Friday’ Sequel Bumps Songs From Original & New Movies\nIt was a sequel fans had waited over 20 years for: Freakier Friday debuted in theaters on Aug. 8, as the follow-up to 2003’s Freaky Friday, starring Jamie Lee Curits and Lindsay Lohan (itself a remake of the 1978 original with Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris). The movie is off to a respectable box office start, and has also resulted in major streaming gains for the songs featured in the movie — in which Pink Slip, Anna (Lohan)’s band from the original movie reunites — as well as for Pink Slip classics from the ‘03 original.\nThe Freakier Friday soundtrack drew 879,000 official U.S. on-demand streams in total for the week ending Aug. 14 following the film’s release, according to Luminate — a gain of 153% over the prior week. That’s led by nearly 586,000 streams for Pink Slip’s re-recorded “Take Me Away,” nearly triple its tally the previous week. And there was enough enthusiasm left for peak Pink Slip from the new movie that the group’s “Ultimate” from Freaky also saw a spike, rising 74% to 229,000 streams for the week. (You can find the full story of all these songs in our Pink Slip reunion oral history here.) – ANDREW UNTERBERGER\nViral ‘Milkaholic’ TikTok Trend Revives 20-Year-Old Metal Song\nBetween Sleep Token and Ghost topping the Billboard 200 earlier this year and a Pierce the Veil deep cut going viral, hard rock and metal are having notable moments in 2025. U.K. hardcore band Her Words Kill is the latest act to benefit from this wave, thanks to its fast-rising hit, “Sir, This Is a Cutthroat Fashion.” Originally released on 2005’s Load My Revolver, Baby LP, “Cutthroat Fashion” has found new life as the primary song for a new “milkaholic” TikTok trend, inspired by Tom & Jerry.\nIn essence, TikTok users take shots of milk, intending to evoke the feeling of hitting rock bottom and nursing one’s alcoholism after a particularly rough day. User @noahnestell kicked off the trend with a Jul. 31 post set to “Cutthroat Fashion” and focusing on the lyrics, “Better pack your tears into a suitcase/ And run away with my heart.” As the trend evolved, users swapped out milk for other non-alcoholic beverages such as Yakult and matcha. The sound attached to user @noahnestell’s original video has garnered over 253,600 posts, while the official “Cutthroat Fashion” sound boasts just under 250 posts.\nAccording to Luminate, “Cutthroat Fashion” earned just over 7,000 official on-demand U.S. streams during the week of July 18-24. That figure leapt 869% to nearly 70,000 official streams the following week (July 25-31), which included the day user @noahnestell shared his video. By the week of Aug. 1-7, “Cutthroat Fashion” grew a further 586% to over 476,000 official streams, and one week later (Aug. 8-14), the streaming activity jumped another 65% to over 790,000 official on-demand U.S. streams. — KD",

On last week’s episode of Travis and Jason Kelce’s New Heights podcast, the superstar revealed her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, due out Oct. 3. Along with the announcement, she also dropped a few key details: the cover art, a concise 12-song tracklist (a sharp contrast to the 31-track “data dump” — as Swift referred to it on the podcast — of The Tortured Poets Department), a guest feature from Sabrina Carpenter and the return of longtime producers/collaborators Max Martin and Shellback, who helped craft some of Swift’s biggest hits from Red, 1989 and reputation.\nThe rollout marks another fascinating chapter in Swift’s career, and has left fans curious about what to expect. In the podcast, though, she said “[The album is] a lot more upbeat, and it’s a lot more fun pop excitement. My main goals were melodies that were so infectious, you’re almost angry at it.” She added that all 12 songs are “bangers” — not unlike the past hits she made with the Swedish pop masterminds, such as “Shake It Off” and “Blank Space.”\n“We’ve never actually made an album before where it was just the three of us, there’s no other collaborators,” she said. “It felt like catching lightning in a bottle. These guys, they’re just geniuses. Working with them again was absolutely incredible.”\nOne thing we know for certain is that Swift is in for a big chart week. She’s already rewritten the Billboard record books countless times, and each new release seems to add more milestones to her résumé.\nWith six weeks until Showgirl arrives, here’s a look at some of the biggest chart records Swift could break — in some cases against fellow superstars, and in others, against herself.\n-\nMost No. 1 Albums on the Billboard 200 Among Solo Artists\nSwift is currently tied with Drake and Jay-Z for the most No. 1 albums among solo artists with 14 No. 1s apiece, dating to the chart’s launch in March 1956. If Showgirl debuts on top, she’ll be the first solo artist to tally 15 No. 1s — unless, perhaps, Drake drops his anticipated new album Iceman before Oct. 3. The Beatles lead all acts with 19 No. 1 albums.\n-\nMost Consecutive Calendar Years at No. 1 on the Billboard 200\nIf Showgirl opens at No. 1, Swift will extend her run of yearly chart-toppers to seven (2019-2025), tying The Beatles for the most consecutive calendar years with a new No. 1 album. The Fab Four reached the top every year from 1964-70. Swift has earned nine of her 14 total No. 1 albums in that span.\n-\nLargest Streaming Week for an Album\nThe Tortured Poets Department holds the record as the album with the largest streaming week ever, with 891.37 million on-demand official U.S. streams generated in its opening week (April 19-25, 2024). Since Showgirl is expected to have far fewer tracks (12 compared to 31), it will be much tougher to beat that record. But if anyone can outdo herself, it’s Swift.\n-\nMost Vinyl Albums Sold in a Single Week in the Modern Era\nThe Tortured Poets Department also set the record here, selling 859,000 vinyl copies on the chart dated May 4, 2024 — the most for an album in a single week since Luminate began tracking music sales in 1991. We know that The Life of a Showgirl is already available for preorder, and Swift announced Monday (Aug. 18) that two special vinyl variants were available in her webstore, named The Life of a Showgirl: The Shiny Bug Edition. Both versions, available for preorder for only 48 hours (or “while supplies last”), reportedly sold out in less than an hour. So we can be sure to expect another blockbuster vinyl week. The question is: can she clear that 859,000 bar?\n-\nMost Albums to Sell 1,000,000 Copies in a Single Week in the Modern Era\nSince 1991, only 24 albums have sold 1 million-plus in the U.S. in a single week (in pure sales). Of those 24, Swift has the most, with seven (*NSYNC, Backstreet Boys and Eminem are tied for the second-most, with two apiece). If Showgirl joins the club, she’ll extend her record to eight. Swift cleared the 1-million mark with, in order: Speak Now (1.046 million; Nov. 13, 2010), Red (1.208 million; Nov. 10, 2012), 1989 (1.286 million; Nov. 15, 2014), reputation (1.216 million; Dec. 2, 2017), Midnights (1.14 million; Nov. 5, 2022), 1989 (Taylor’s Version) (1.359 million; Nov. 11, 2023) and The Tortured Poets Department (1.913 million; May 4, 2024).\n-\nOnly Artist to Sweep the Top 10 of the Hot 100 Three Times\nSwift famously blanketed the entire top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 on Nov. 5, 2022, after releasing Midnights, and then outdid herself by claiming the entire top 14 with Tortured Poets. With Showgirl’s expected 12 tracks, she can’t claim that record, but she could become the first artist to claim the entire top 10 three times, a feat no one else has achieved even once.\n-\nMost No. 1 Songs on the Hot 100 of the 2020s\nSwift and Drake have both scored seven No. 1 songs on the Hot 100 in the 2020s so far — tied for the most among all artists this decade. If a track from Showgirl tops the chart, she’ll surpass him for the most (unless, of course, Drake scores a new No. 1 before then).\n-\nMost Top 5s, Top 10s, Top 20s, Top 40s and Overall Entries on the Hot 100 Among Women\nAmong women, Swift already holds the records for the most top 5s (36), top 10s (59), top 20s (100), top 40s (165) and overall entries (264). Among all artists, only Drake ranks higher on these lists. But the 12 tracks from Showgirl could help her narrow the gap, or at least extend her lead among women.",

Here are all the possible Easter Egg clues hinting that she might.\nsitename: Billboard\ndate: 2025-08-19\ncategories: ['Pop']\ntags: ['genre pop, sports, Super Bowl Halftime Show']\n---\nTaylor Swift has traveled all over the world on tour, setting numerous stadium attendance records throughout her career. But there’s still one highly coveted gig she hasn’t yet played: the Super Bowl.\nThough rumors about her headlining the coveted halftime show spring up just about every year before the actual performer is announced, the pop star hasn’t yet joined folks such as Kendrick Lamar, Usher, Rihanna and The Weeknd in crossing it off her list. That’s remained true even as she’s become more entrenched in the football world than ever before over the past two years, cheering on her Kansas City Chiefs tight end boyfriend Travis Kelce at many of his games — including two back-to-back Super Bowls — after the pair first started dating in 2023.\nLately, though, fans have been wondering if that’s due to change — and soon. Especially as Swift gears up to release the Oct. 3-slated album The Life of a Showgirl — which she’s promised will be tailored for widespread commercial appeal, with a track list full of “bangers” produced by bona fide hitmakers Max Martin and Shellback — some of the 14-time Grammy winner’s listeners are beginning to suspect that the musician is hinting that the 2026 Super Bowl at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, will feature a spectacular showcase from pop’s biggest showgirl herself.\nThe announcement for next year’s headliner could be just a few weeks away, as the past few years’ performers have all been unveiled in September. That means the timing of Swift coming out with a new album so soon after 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department would perfectly align with a Super Bowl reveal. (But honestly, baby, who’s counting?)\nWith all that in mind, Billboard is keeping track of all the ways Swift might be hinting that she’ll play more of a role in next year’s big game than simply supporting her favorite player in the stands. Keep reading to see all the possible clues that the musician is headlining Super Bowl LX below.\n-\nThe Super Bowl Talk on ‘New Heights’\nOn Aug. 13, Swift announced the Oct. 3 release date of The Life of a Showgirl at the same time as her debut episode on Travis and Jason Kelce’s New Heights podcast dropped. The topic of the Super Bowl came up casually (or perhaps, not so casually) a couple of times, including when the pop star revealed that she learned she’d purchased the rights to her master recordings just a few months after she attended the 2025 Super Bowl.\nShe discussed the event — and more specifically, its halftime program — again later on in the episode while detailing how little she used to pay attention to football growing up. “My relationship with sports was like, I grew up in Pennsylvania, I always heard my dad yelling at the screen watching Eagles games,” she said. “I was up in my room playing guitar, learning instruments, playing piano — I was focused on different things. I would go to sporting events so that I could sing the national anthem. I know every halftime show from the Super Bowls, but I didn’t watch the sports.”\nWere all of those mentions of the Super Bowl just happenstance, or was Swift hinting at something more? With her, one can never be sure.\n-\nThe Sourdough\nAlso on New Heights, Swift just so happened to shout out one of her new favorite hobbies: “Right now we’re deep in a sourdough obsession that has taken over my life … I’m really talking about bread 60% of the time now.”\nWhy is that significant? Two reasons. Not only is Sourdough Sam the name of the mascot for the San Francisco 49ers — aka the team whose Levi’s Stadium home is the site of next year’s Super Bowl — but the next NFL season-ending game will be the 60th Super Bowl, matching the percentage Swift used to describe her high level of bread talk as of late.\n-\nThe Suspicious “47”\nMuch like the topic of the Super Bowl itself, Swift repeatedly brought up a certain number while on New Heights: 47. Following a particularly energetic intro from Jason Kelce listing her accomplishments at the beginning of the episode, the singer said, “Thank you for screaming for like 47 seconds for me, that was so nice!”\nLater, when Jason asked how many countries she’d visited over the course of her Eras Tour, Swift quipped, “47,000,” even though the real answer is 21.\nStay with us. In the sequence of 149 total shows Swift played while on her global Eras trek, the 47th one took place in July 2023 at Levi’s Stadium — the same place where SBLX is set to go down next February. The musician also chose a sparkly orange outfit to wear while performing “Shake It Off” at one of her shows in Santa Clara (as pictured above), which was possibly one of the earliest Easter Eggs she deployed to tease the distinctly orange color scheme of her then-unannounced Life of a Showgirl album.\nYou may be wondering if placing such significance on the numbers 47 and 60 is too much of a stretch — but it’s worth remembering that Swift is a known fan of hiding clues about her next moves in numbers. Even on New Heights, she said, “The art of the Easter Egg … there’s do’s and don’ts. I love numerology, I love math stuff, I love dates. That stuff I find really fun.”\n-\nThe Levi’s of a ‘Showgirl’\nEvery brand from Target to Crumbl, FedEx, McDonald’s and more shared Swift-themed posts in light of her stepping into the Showgirl era, but one in particular stands out. Denim company Levi’s — the company behind Levi’s Stadium — shared a video of someone sewing a sparkly orange tag into the pocket of a pair of jeans in honor of the pop star announcing her new album.\n“subtle swap for the big day,” the caption read.\nNow, the post may have just been Levi’s getting in on the trend. But maybe, just maybe, it was actually the business’ way of hinting that Swift will play at its stadium next February.\n-\nThe Masters of It All\nIt’s worth noting that this coming Super Bowl will be the first to ever take place in a world where Swift owns her masters. After spending her career working to gain ownership of her first six albums, the singer was finally able to buy them from Shamrock Holdings in May.\nOn New Heights, Swift spoke about how meaningful it’s been for her to have control of her life’s work. It also goes without saying that the singer is likely more keen to perform her early hits on the most-watched televised event of the year now that she, and no other entities — such as Scooter Braun, whose initial purchase of her catalog in 2019 she vehemently opposed — will be the only one to benefit financially from the show.",

But a federal judge last week dismissed 21 of the 22 counts in her lawsuit, including racketeering, assault and battery, forced labor, and false imprisonment.\nEven after his recent courtroom wins, Diddy is hardly out of the woods. He’s still facing dozens of other civil lawsuits from other alleged victims, accusing him of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment and various other forms of sexual abuse. And he’s still going to be sentenced in October on the lesser criminal charges on which he was convicted – counts that could still send him to prison for years.

Prosecutors alleged that Del Villar repeatedly arranged concerts with Jesus Pérez Alvear, a promoter with ties to Mexican cartels – even though he knew he had been sanctioned by federal authorities.\nTORY’S APPEAL – Attorneys for Tory Lanez (Daystar Peterson) went before a California appeals court for a crucial hearing in his efforts to overturn his convictions for shooting Megan Thee Stallion. They told the panel that Lanez’s trial was “riddled with errors,” including misleading statements about DNA evidence and a key witness they were not allowed to properly cross examine. But the government was unconcerned, calling some of Lanez’s arguments non-sensical: “The evidence in this case was compelling.”\nDISCOVERY DRAMA – Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge fired back at Drake’s demand to read his emails amid the ongoing defamation lawsuit over the Kendrick Lamar diss track “Not Like Us,” calling the request “farcical” and “ridiculous.” He told a judge that it “makes no sense whatsoever” that the boss of the world’s largest music company would play a role in the release of a single song and that Drake was trying to “waste my and UMG’s time.”\nUNSURPRISING DIVORCE – Kate Bowman, the wife of founding Maroon 5 bassist Mickey Madden, filed for divorce, just two weeks after she sought a restraining order in which she accused the musician of beating her during a confrontation about disturbing and sexual texts he’d sent to teenage girls.

Isaacs and Peter J. Gleason), Dylan’s lawyers said they made “heinous and false allegations” without sufficient vetting and then repeatedly violated a court order by failing to get their client to turn over key evidence.\nUGLY ACCUSATIONS – Priscilla Presley’s former business partners (Brigitte Kruse and Kevin Fialko) fired back at her recent allegations of elder abuse against them, filing a countersuit that included the shocking accusation that Elvis Presley’s widow “pulled the plug” on Lisa Marie Presley against her late daughter’s wishes. Priscilla’s attorney — veteran entertainment lawyer Martin Singer — quickly called the case a “disgusting publicity stunt” and “one of the most shameful, ridiculous, salacious, and meritless lawsuits I have seen in my practice.”\nDEFAULT JUDGMENT – Jimmie Allen was judged liable for sexually assaulting and secretly filming a woman in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2022. Allen has denied those accusations, but a judge ruled that he had forfeited his right to defend himself by flouting multiple court-imposed deadlines and orders in the lawsuit. The case is one of two civil sexual assault lawsuits brought against Allen in 2023, derailing the singer’s promising career; the first was settled in 2024.\nGEFFEN RESPONDS – Music and film mogul David Geffen filed his first response to a bombshell abuse lawsuit from his estranged husband Donovan Michaels, calling them “a ludicrous and contrived attempt to humiliate Geffen in the court of public opinion and extract an out-of-court settlement.” The case from Michaels, a former exotic dancer 50 years Geffen’s junior, claimed that the Hollywood powerhouse treated him as a “sexual commodity” for years.\nKINGSTON SENTENCING – Sean Kingston was sentenced to 42 months (3.5 years) in prison and three years probation after being convicted of federal wire fraud over a scheme involving over $1 million in high-end cars, jewelry and other luxury goods.

In addition to being friends with the 14-time Grammy winner for years, Kravitz has co-written songs with Swift in the past, lending her pen to Midnights opening track “Lavender Haze.”\nThe two women are so close, in fact, that Kravitz stayed at one of Swift’s homes with mom Lisa Bonet after having to evacuate her own residence amid the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year. While there, the two women accidentally lost Bonet’s pet snake Orpheus inside the Eras Tour headliner’s bathroom, resulting in Swift’s house manager having to take apart the musician’s cabinetry in order to get the reptile out.\n“We completely destroyed Taylor’s bathroom, and there was just this moment where I was like, ‘Either we destroy her bathroom, or I have to tell her that there’s a snake somewhere in her house,'” Kravitz recalled Aug. 12 on Late Night With Seth Meyers. “I remember calling her and saying, ‘Hey … I wanted to talk to you about something,’ and she was like, ‘Is it the fact that you almost lost a snake in our house and destroyed my bathroom?'”\nKravitz’s comments on Showgirl come less than a week after Swift announced that her 12th studio album is set to arrive Oct. 3. Produced by Max Martin and Shellback, the project features 12 tracks — including a collaboration with Sabrina Carpenter.\n“[The album is] a lot more upbeat, and it’s a lot more fun pop excitement,” Swift said of Showgirl on boyfriend Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce’s New Heights podcast. “My main goals were melodies that were so infectious, you’re almost angry at it.”",

Talk about manifestation!\nFans have been loving the unexpected pairing ever since, with Swifties christening the couple “Tayvis” and, at one point, starting a hilarious trend on TikTok of telling their male partners that Swift put Kelce “on the map.” And while the coupling between Swift and Kelce might seem random to the casual entertainment consumer, Billboard is here to help trace back how the two titans of their very different industries have come together and fallen in love over the course of many headline-making months. Below, we’ve compiled a full timeline of all the most notable moments in their relationship, from the football player trying to give a friendship bracelet to Swift during her July 2023 Eras Tour stop in Kansas City to all of their football game outings, concert appearances and mushy-gushy interview moments talking about their relationship that have happened ever since.\nSo if you’ve managed to escape the barrage of news coverage and social media discourse on Swift and Kelce’s relationship and need to catch up on how one of the most high-profile couples of the decade came to be — or you just want to relive the high points of their all-American romance — there’s no need to look any further. Keep reading to see a full, continuously updating timeline of the musician and athlete’s adorable love story in chronological order:\n-\nJuly 8, 2023: Travis Attends the Eras Tour\nThe football star was spotted Swift’s Eras Tour stop at Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium in July, marking the first public linking between the two.\n-\nJuly 26, 2023: Travis Shoots His Shot & Fails\nDuring an episode of his New Heights podcast, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end recounted his foiled plan to begin wooing the “Karma” singer. Inspired by the lyric “So make the friendship bracelets / Take the moment and taste it” from Midnight’s “You’re On Your Own, Kid,” fans have been trading homemade jewelry at each Eras Tour stop, and Kelce tried to get in on the trend.\n“I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,” Kelce said, “so I was a little butt-hurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her.”\nHe went on to explain that the bracelet he wanted to give her had his phone number on it. Evidently, Kelce’s plan was not successful. “She doesn’t meet anybody, or at least she didn’t want to meet me, so I took it personal,” he quipped.\n-\nSept. 14, 2023: Travis Is Coy About Taylor\nDuring an interview with NFL+ host Andrew Siciliano, Travis somewhat addressed the rumors. He confirmed his story about trying to shoot his shot at Swift via an Eras Tour friendship bracelet, but that’s as far as he’d reveal. “I said what I said. And I meant what I said when I said it. And you know what, it is what it is,” he said before shutting down further conversation about the pair’s relationship status. “I’m not gonna talk about my personal life.”\nThe tight end then teased listeners, saying, “I know what you writers wanna hear, and you wanna hear more about that and I’m not gonna give you anything!” When Siciliano asked if Swift had reached out to him, Kelce responded, “And that’s gonna wrap it up here,” thus ending the interview.\nTravis’ brother, Philadelphia Eagles player Jason Kelce, was also asked about the pairing during an interview. “I’ve seen these rumors, I cannot comment,” he said of romance speculation\n-\nSept. 17, 2023: Travis Laughs Off NFL Commentary\nDuring the game between the Chiefs and the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday (Sept. 17), NFL announcer Ian Eagle slipped in a few Swift lyric references as he called a play from Kelce. “Kelce finds a blank space for the score!” he said, a callback to Swift’s 2014 Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper “Blank Space.”\nNFL Network’s Rich Eisen loaded in plenty of Swift references in his pre-game coverage, as he teased, “You saw it on Thursday night, when Travis Kelce wasn’t in there, it left a ‘blank space,’ but I think he returns today and proves to be the ‘anti-hero.’ Never goes out of ‘style.’”\nIt was all in good fun, as Kelce himself later commented on Eisen’s medley via Instagram, writing, “Well played Rich…. Well played 👏🏻😂.” See the post here.\n-\nSept. 21, 2023: The Ball Is in Taylor’s Court\nThe Kansas City Chiefs tight end joined The Pat McAfee Show, where he revealed that he invited Swift to watch him play. “I threw the ball in her court,” he said. “I told her, ‘I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead, you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead.’ We’ll see what happens in the near future.”\nHe also expressed his surprise at how much publicity their potential relationship has gotten. “It’s hilarious how much traction this has actually got,” the 33-year-old said. “I think it’s, right now, it’s like that old game in school called ‘Telephone,’ where everybody is just whispering in each other’s ear, just hearing some random stuff.”\n-\nSept. 24, 2023: The Big Game\nSwift shocked football fans and Swifties alike when she spent the day cheering on the Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end from Kelce’s suite alongside his mom, Donna, as the team played the Chicago Bears (and won).\nThe two also left the stadium together, as seen in a clip sports reporter Jarrett Payton shared on X. In the video, the NFL star nods in greeting to the anchor and asks, “How you doin’” as Tay flashes Payton a smile and says, “Hey!”\nKelce and Swift were then spotted riding off together in his convertible, according to photos acquired by TMZ.\n-\nSept. 26, 2023: Travis Says Taylor Looked “Amazing” at the Game\nJason and Travis reflected on the game in their New Heights podcast. “Shoutout to Taylor for pulling up!” Travis said. “That was pretty ballsy. That was pretty ballsy, yeah. I just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her, the friends and family — she looked amazing. Everybody was talking about her in great light and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course.”\n“To see the slow-motion chest bumps, to see the high-fives with Mom, to see how Chiefs Kingdom was all excited that she was there,” he added. “It was definitely a game I’ll remember, that’s for d–n sure. Then we just slid off in the getaway car at the end. Took my Chevelle to the game.”\n-\nSept. 29, 2023: “Welcome to New York”\nNBC used Swift’s “Welcome to New York” in a TV commercial promoting the Chiefs’ upcoming game against the New York Jets.\n-\nOct. 1, 2023: Taylor’s Second Football Date\nThe Kansas City Chiefs were set to play the New York Jets, which meant Kelce was in Swift’s area this time — she has a New York City residence. This time around, it was no surprise that the pop icon showed up at MetLife Stadium to support Kelce and his team. She arrived with a group of famous friends, including Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds.\n“Welcome to New York, it’s been waiting for you,” the official NFL account tweeted to Swift on X before the game began, sharing clips of her greeting others at the stadium and enjoying the game.\n-\nOct. 12, 2023: Third Time’s the Charm\nOne day after the star-studded film premiere for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in Los Angeles, the pop star made her way back to Kansas City to watch Kelce’s Thursday Night Football match-up against the Denver Broncos. Swift once again joined Donna Kelce in the family suite at Arrowhead Stadium and she showed off her latest KC style, rocking a throwback Chiefs windbreaker with a black miniskirt and black heeled boots at the game.\n-\nOct. 15, 2023: Taylor & Travis Holding Hands\nAfter weeks of a rumored romance, Swift and Kelce all but confirmed their budding relationship by arriving hand in hand for the post-show bash at Catch Steak in New York City following the Saturday Night Live season 49 premiere on Oct. 14.\nDuring the Pete Davidson-hosted episode, the singer and NFL star made separate surprise cameos. Swift popped up to introduce musical guest Ice Spice’s second song and Kelce appeared toward the end of a hilarious sketch poking fun at NFL’s recent obsessive coverage of the singer.\nEarlier in the evening, Swift and Kelce also grabbed a pre-show dinner at Nobu in NYC, according to photos published by Page Six, which show the lovebirds holding hands once again.\n-\nOct. 22, 2023: Another Weekend at Arrowhead\nKansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium must be starting to feel awfully familiar to Swift, who showed up there in support of Kelce and his team again on Oct. 22 for the Chiefs-Chargers game. She’s now a repeat guest at the stadium, having attended multiple Chiefs games and having brought her own show there twice, once on her Reputation Tour and again on The Eras Tour. On Oct. 22, Swift wore a Chiefs sweatshirt and an ’87’ friendship bracelet in Kelce’s honor, and she had fun watching the game with Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Swift later left the venue with Kelce at her side, holding hands on their way out.\n-\nOct. 23, 2023: Photo of Taylor Kissing Travis Surfaces\nWe still remember that look on his face, when Taylor planted a kiss on his cheek! One day after the pop superstar attended the Chiefs vs. Chargers game at Arrowhead Stadium, a photo of Swift giving the Kansas City tight end a sweet smooch surfaced on Instagram courtesy of Chariah Gordon, who is dating Chiefs’ wide receiver Mecole Hardman.\n-\nNov. 11, 2023: Onstage Official in Buenos Aires\nNow that Swift is back on tour, Kelce was spotted at his first Eras show since July, which was when the two were first publicly linked. The Kansas City Chiefs tight end attended her Buenos Aires, Argentina, concert Saturday night (Nov. 11). In fan-filmed clips that were immediately posted to social media, the football star was seen in the VIP tent at Estadio River Plate — with Swift’s dad, Scott, by his side. The night before, Swift and Kelce were seen out to dinner at Argentinian steakhouse Elena, a restaurant in the Four Seasons Hotel.\nBut it was the last act of the concert that really got the crowd’s attention: Swift swapped the “Karma” lyric “Karma is the guy in the screen coming straight home to me” for “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me,” and then ran into Kelce’s arms to kiss him once the show wrapped.\n-\nNov. 20, 2023: Travis Opens Up\nIn an in-depth interview with the Wall Street Journal, Kelce explained what exactly went down in between his friendship bracelet phone number fiasco and Swift’s first game day spent at Arrowhead Stadium. Revealing that Swift reached out to him after someone on her team — or possibly a family member — put him on her radar, Kelce also shared that he and the pop star had already been talking for some time before they first met in person in New York.\n-\nDec. 1, 2023: Double Date With The Mahomes\nTaylor and Travis got in the holiday spirit together on the first of December by attending a holiday bar in Kansas City with Patrick and Brittany Mahomes. In fan pictures that surfaced from the night, hosted at Miracle Pop Up, both the “Christmas Tree Farm” singer and tight end donned festive sweaters, meanwhile the Mahomes’ sported matching reindeer onesies.\n-\nDec. 6, 2023: Taylor Speaks Out\nThe pop superstar opened up about when her romance with Travis Kelce began for TIME, who named her its Person of the Year. “This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell … We started hanging out right after that,” she shared of the July 26 episode of his New Heights podcast, in which he revealed that he had made a friendship bracelet with his phone number to give her when he attended her July 8 Eras Tour show at Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium.\n“By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,” she revealed. “I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.”\n-\nJan. 1, 2024: New Year’s Kiss\nTaylor and Travis were each other’s New Year’s kisses as they rang in 2024 at a party. The scene looked like something out of, well, a Taylor Swift song, with the singer looking princess-like in a sparkly gown as confetti rained down overhead.\n-\nJan. 21, 2024: Taylor Meets Jason\nAt the Chiefs’ playoff game against the Buffalo Bills, Taylor finally got to meet Travis’ brother, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, and sister-in-law Kylie Kelce. And Jason definitely made quite the impression — on both the singer-songwriter and the rest of America: Several videos of him in the box guzzling beer with his shirt off and jumping into the stands to mingle with Bills fans afterward went viral.\n“Tay said she absolutely loved you,” Travis revealed after the game on the brothers’ joint podcast New Heights.\n“I’m not going to lie, I gave Kylie a heads-up,” recalled Jason. “The moment we get into the suite, I said, ‘I’m taking my shirt off and jumping out of that suite.’ And she said, ‘Jason don’t you dare.’”\n“She was already telling me to be on my best behavior ’cause we were meeting Taylor, so she’s like, ‘Do not. Be on your best behavior,’” he added. “I was like, ‘Kylie, the first day I met you I was blackout drunk and fell asleep at the bar. This is part of the charm. This is part of the Jason Kelce charm. I wanna make my best first impression.’”\n-\nJan. 26, 2024: Travis Speaks Out\nDuring a Kansas City Chiefs press conference, Travis gave an update about how he and Taylor are handling the public’s attention to their relationship. “As long as we’re happy, we can’t listen to anything that’s outside noise,” he told reporters. “Thats all that matters.”\nThe athlete added, “I brought this upon myself, and I do enjoy having fun with it all, and the biggest thing is making sure my focus is right here in this building.”\n-\nJan. 28, 2024: Travis Says “I Love You”\nTravis had Swifties in their feels when, minutes after the Chiefs won against the Baltimore Ravens at the AFC Championship gam — earning Kansas City a spot in the Super Bowl for a second year in a row — he told Taylor he loved her.\n“Tay, I’m going to enjoy with the guys,” he told the pop star, who had joined him on the field, before kissing her. “I love you.”\nThen, wrapping Tay in a tight hug, he added, “So much it’s not funny.”\nOther sweet moments from the game include Taylor cheering Travis on with his family in a box suite at M&T Bank Stadium in Maryland, kissing him several times on the field, and adoringly watching him give a speech to Chiefs Kingdom.\n-\nJan. 31, 2024: Travis’ Revelation\nBy this point, Taylor had already confirmed that she and Travis were a couple before she ever stepped foot in Arrowhead Stadium to watch the Chiefs-Bears game in September 2023. But during a visit to the The Pat McAfee Show in late January, the athlete finally revealed the near-exact starting point of the Tayvis timeline.\n“We had known each other for close to a month up to that point,” he said. “It wasn’t just an out of the blue, ‘Hey, come to the game.’”\nThat means Travis started courting the singer either at the end of August or the very beginning of September 2023.\n“I love it when Taylor comes and supports me and enjoys the game with the fam and friends,” Kelce told McAFee. “It’s been nothing but a wonderful year, man.”\n-\nFeb. 11, 2024: The Super Bowl\nJust hours after closing out her final Eras show in Tokyo, Swift arrived at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas to cheer on Kelce and the Chiefs at Super Bowl LVIII. She wore a red bomber jacket, bejeweled black pants and an “87” necklace — plus her signature red lip, of course.\nThe pop star’s posse included Blake Lively, Ice Spice, Lana Del Rey and Swift’s parents, Scott and Andrea, who joined her in chatting with the Kelce family before the game.\n-\nFeb. 22-23, 2024: Tayvis Takes on Sydney\nAhead of Taylor’s shows in Sydney, Travis flew out to meet the star in Australia and joined her on a date to the Sydney Zoo on Feb. 22. The pair held hands and took selfies as they checked out the animals.\nThe next day, Travis danced along to his girlfriend’s Feb. 23 set from a VIP tent with Katy Perry, Rita Ora and Baz Luhrmann, and exchanged friendship bracelets with fans at Accor Stadium. Toward the end of her performance, Taylor once again dedicated an updated “Karma” lyric to the athlete: “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.”\nAfter the show, the singer emerged from backstage and kissed Travis in the wings.\n-\nApril 13, 2024: Date Night at Coachella\nSwift made a rare appearance at Coachella with Kelce on her arm as the couple attended Ice Spice and Bleachers’ festival sets, packing on the PDA and dancing along in the crowds. “I absolutely love live music,” the tight end later said of the experience on New Heights. “Our guy Jack Antonoff absolutely ripped it.”\n“I like to see it from the fans’ perspective, ‘cause I am, I’m a fan of music,” he added of opting to watch the “Munch” rapper’s performance with Swift from the pit instead of a VIP area. “I want to see it from the front of the stage … I think it’s that much more of an experience if you’re in the pit, if you’re in the madness with all the fans.”\n-\nApril 19, 2024: “The Alchemy”\nWhen The Tortured Poets Department dropped promptly at midnight April 19, 2024, fans were quick to notice that one of the 16 main tracks on Swift’s new album definitely seemed to be an ode to Kelce. That’s mainly because of the several football vocab words the pop star sprinkled throughout the track, which finds her swooning over an intense, chemically fixed attraction to a new lover.\n“When I touch down, call the amateurs and cut ’em from the team,” Swift sings on “The Alchemy.” “These blokes warm the benches/ We’ve been on a winning streak/ He jokes that ‘It’s heroin, but this time with an E.’”\n“Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads,” she continues in a bridge full of lyrics reminiscent of the couple’s post-Super Bowl celebrations. “Beer sticking to the floor, cheers chanted ’cause they said/ There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league/ Where’s the trophy? He just comes running over to me.”\nListen to the song below:\n-\nApril 27, 2024: Significant Other Status\nWhile auctioning off four Eras Tour tickets on behalf of Swift at the 15 and The Mahomies Foundation charity gala in Las Vegas, Kelce lovingly referred to the pop star as his “significant other.”\n“I was just talking to my significant other, and we might have one other auction item that wasn’t on the docket,” he said in a coy voice. “Has anybody heard of The Eras Tour?”\nAs bids rose as high as $80,000 for the seats, Swift cheered Kelce on from her spot at Brittany Mahomes’ table. The couple also held hands as they walked through the venue, looking stunning in their evening attire.\n-\nMay 9, 2024: Taylor Pays Tribute to Travis\nAt her first Eras Tour concert following the release of The Tortured Poets Department, Swift added several new numbers from the album to her three-hour showcase — including “So High School,” which fans believe she wrote about Kelce. The comeback shows took place in Paris, with the football player in attendance. (“It is absolutely unbelievable,” he later gushed. “I enjoyed every bit of it … I don’t know if they’re just getting better or if I just keep forgetting how they are.”)\nDuring the song, the singer also appeared to pay tribute to her beau’s team by swag surfing with her dancers, a Chiefs Kingdom tradition.\n-\nJune 23, 2024: Travis Makes His Eras Tour Debut\nSwift and Kelce shocked the crowd at Wembley Stadium in London when the NFL star joined his superstar girlfriend on stage, stepping out in a tuxedo and top hat midway through the Tortured Poets Department set. In clips from the cameo, the athlete carries the singer in his arms, fans her, dusts her face with a makeup brush and hilariously coaches her on how to dance before her next number: “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.”\nThe following day, Swift shared photos and video from Kelce’s performance and wrote, “I’m still cracking up/swooning over @killatrav’s Eras Tour debut 🥰”\n-\nJune 25, 2024: Travis Reflects on Their Romance\nDuring an appearance on the Bussin’ With the Boys podcast, Kelce reflected on the moment he first realized he was falling in love with Swift. “The first game she came to against the Bears, I was like, ‘I could probably set you up with everything,’” he recalled. “And she just walked through the front door. There was no going down, talking to security … She was just like, ‘I want to be around the family and friends and experience this with everybody.’”\nThe tight end also opened up about feeling proud of his relationship. “You want to keep things private, but at the same time, I’m not here to hide anything,” he explained. “That’s my girl. That’s my lady. I’m proud of that. I’m not sitting here trying to juggle, ‘How can I keep this under wraps?’”\n-\nJune 22, 2024: Instagram Official\nAlmost a year into their romance, Swift finally posted a picture with Kelce on her Instagram grid. Their selfie also just so happened to include Prince William and two of his three kids — Prince George and Princess Charlotte — who attended one of the singer’s Eras Tour shows at Wembley Stadium.\n“Dude, he was the coolest motherf—-r,” Travis later said on New Heights of the elder prince. “He was so cool. They were an absolute delight to meet. Wasn’t sure if I was supposed to bow to them, curtsy, just be an American idiot and shake their hand … We wanted to be polite, especially on this side of the park.”\n-\nJune 30, 2024: Dublin Love\nIn a viral moment from one of Swift’s Dublin concerts, the singer appeared to light up with joy upon spotting Kelce entering the venue. After the show, the tight end escorted his girlfriend out of the backstage area and gestured to the surrounding fans to give her some well-earned applause, making her blush.\nWhile in town, the couple also reportedly hit up a bar alongside Eras opener Paramore and Stevie Nicks.\n-\nJuly 17, 2024: Eras Tour in Gelsenkirchen\nKelce was present at Swift’s Eras stop in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, where fan cameras spotted him dancing along to the three-hour-plus set and proudly filming his girlfriend as she sang “So High School,” which fans are pretty certain Swift wrote about him.\nHe was also in attendance at the star’s show the following night, immediately after which he assumed his unofficial duty of walking her out from the backstage area.\n-\nSept. 3, 2024: Coach Taylor\nA couple days after Patrick Mahomes revealed that Swift enjoys drawing up her own plays for the Chiefs, Kelce confirmed his girlfriend’s hobby in an interview with The Rich Eisen Show.\n“She had just been so open to learning the game,” he explained. “She didn’t know much about the rules and everything … She’s just so detailed and a part of it, that I think she was just curious about the profession. I know none of the plays have gotten to Coach [Andy] Reid yet. If they ever do, I’ll let everyone know it was her creation.”\nHe added, “She’s a little biased and just creates plays for me.”\n-\nSept. 4, 2024: Travis’ Reps Deny Breakup Plan\nAfter the internet started circulating documents that allegedly outlined what Kelce’s PR strategy would be if he and Swift ever broke up, the tight end’s team was quick to debunk them.\n“These documents are entirely false and fabricated and were not created, issued, or authorized by this agency,” stated a spokesperson for Full Scope Public Relations, which represents Kelce. “We have engaged our legal team to initiate proceedings against the individuals or entities responsible for the unlawful and injurious forgery of documents.”\n-\nSept. 8, 2024: U.S. Open Date\nSwift and Kelce had one of their most public dates at the 2024 U.S. Open, where they cheered on the players at the Men’s Singles Final match alongside a group of friends that included Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes. While there, the singer and tight end maintained a steady stream of PDA and rocked out to The Darkness’ “I Believe in a Thing Called Love.”\n-\nSept. 11, 2024: Taylor Thanks Travis at the VMAs\nFans at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards erupted into ear-splitting cheers when Swift gave Kelce a sweet shout-out during her video of the year acceptance speech, having secured the prestigious Moon Person for her “Fortnight” collaboration with Post Malone.\n“This video seems very sad when you watch it, but it was actually the most fun video to make,” she told the crowd before recalling how the tight end was present on the shoot. “I would always just hear someone cheering, like, ‘Whoo!’ from across the studio — that one person was my boyfriend, Travis. Everything this man touches turns to happiness and fun and magic, so I want to thank him for adding that to our shoot.”\n-\nOct. 7, 2024: PDA After Chiefs Victory\nMoments after Kansas City won 26-13 against the New Orleans Saints, Kelce joined his superstar girlfriend in her viewing area at Arrowhead Stadium for a sweet PDA-filled moment captured by fans. In one video, Swift hangs onto the tight end’s arm as he chats with a person who appears to be his father, Ed Kelce, before pulling Travis’ face toward hers for a kiss.\nThe New Heights host then wraps the 14-time Grammy winner in a tight hug, the pair swaying back and forth.\n-\nNov. 2, 2024: Dancing to “So High School”\nDuring Swift’s Indianapolis stop on her Eras Tour on Nov. 2, eagle-eyed fans spotted the Kansas City Chiefs tight end in the VIP section of the Lucas Oil Stadium, alongside Swift’s mom. In a fan-captured TikTok, Kelce was seen dancing along with his girlfriend’s mom to the Tortured Poets Department track “So High School,” with the fan filming offering an audible “oh my god” at his moves.\n-\nDec. 11, 2024: Travis Praises Eras Tour\n“The unbelievable Eras Tour has come to an end,” Travis said on his New Heights podcast. “Shout out to everybody that was a part of that show. Obviously, it’s her music, her tour and everything, but that was a full production, man. That thing was the best tour in the world because of a lot of people, but mostly because of Taylor.”When Jason asked how many shows Swift had in the books following the summation of her $2 billion tour — which kicked off in March 2023 — Travis replied, “149 or 152. I forget which one it was. Somewhere in there. A f–k ton is how I sum it up.”\n-\nDec. 13, 2024: Taylor’s 35th Birthday Party\nSwift turned 35 on Dec. 13, and her friends and family surprised her with a fitting Eras Tour-themed birthday bash.\nDuring one sweet moment in the night, Kelce recreated a special moment during the show in which the singer gives her hat to a lucky fan while performing “22.” In a photo from the event, Travis is seen in his outfit from his surprise “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” moment putting the black top hat on his girlfriend.\nSee the photo here.\n-\nFeb. 9, 2025: Super Bowl Round 2\nSwift attended her second Super Bowl in a row on Feb. 9, 2025, showing up to support Kelce alongside Ice Spice, MGK and more stars.\nUnfortunately, the game ended with a less desirable outcome than Swift’s first Super Bowl, with the Chiefs losing 22-40 to the Philadelphia Eagles. The tight end was visibly upset on the field in the moments after the loss, but afterward, he was able to joke that his superstar girlfriend’s music had been helping him through that particular heartbreak.\n-\nJune 4, 2025: Travis Celebrates Taylor Reclaiming Her Masters\nAfter years of publicly butting heads with Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun over the sale of her master recordings in 2019 — plus four Taylor’s Version album re-recordings — Swift finally purchased the rights to her first six LPs in May 2025.\nThe following month, Travis celebrated his partner’s feat on New Heights by cheering, “[She] just bought all her music back … so it’s finally hers.”\nLater, Taylor would appear on New Heights and reveal that she collapsed crying into Travis’ arms when she first got the news that she’d successfully acquired her catalog.\n-\nJune 24, 2025: Tight End University\nSwift accompanied Kelce at his 2025 Tight End University summit in Nashville, appearing alongside him at opening ceremonies and later playing a surprise performance of “Shake It Off” with Kane Brown and his band at Brooklyn Bowl Nashville.\nLater, Kelce would proudly boast about how his girlfriend didn’t even practice before getting up onstage to sing for his guests. “Tay just kind of went up to him and the band and went, ‘Hey, if you guys are down, I’ll go up there, play a song and see if we can pop the roof off this place,’” he recalled on New Heights. “And then just went out there without practicing, and it was pitch-perfect. [She] just killed it.”\n-\nJuly 1, 2025: Travis Denies They’re “Trying to Seek Attention”\nWhile appearing on an episode of Bussin’ With the Boys, Travis refuted claims that he and Swift purposefully try to attract attention when they step out in public. “It gets thrown out there, like we’re trying to seek attention every now and then,” he said on the podcast. “We’re just enjoying life and having fun, going to hockey games. [I’m] kind of introducing her to some more of the sports world.”\n-\nJuly 24, 2025: Travis Recaps His Offseason “Adventures” With Taylor\nAfter about two years of keeping his relationship with Swift largely off of his social media accounts, Kelce surprised fans by sharing numerous photos of himself and the singer on Instagram captioned, “Had some adventures this offseason.”\nIn the pics, he and Swift pose together in matching ship captain hats, get cozy together at a restaurant and play in the snow. Other photos show the tight end with the hitmaker’s brother, Austin, as they hang out with Jason Kelce outdoors — proving that the Kelce and Swift families are super tight.\n-\nAug. 12, 2025: Travis Explains How He Fell in Love With Taylor “Organically”\nIn a GQ cover story, Kelce opened up about how he and Swift fell in love completely “organically,” despite having the world’s attention on them at all times.\n“Whenever I’m with her, it feels like we’re just regular people,” he told the publication. “When there is not a camera on us, we’re just two people that are in love … We fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with. We are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It kind of just took the f–k off.”\nIn that same interview, Kelce also noted how Swift shares important traits with his mom, Donna — “Their kindness, their genuineness, their ability to say hello to everyone in the room” — as well as gushed about how the couple loves being each other’s “plus one.”\n-\nAug. 13, 2025: Taylor Reaches ‘New Heights’\nAfter two years of dating, Swift finally appeared on Kelce’s podcast — and she covered a lot of ground while she was there.\nIn addition to opening up about reclaiming her masters, rediscovering her hobbies post-Eras Tour and taking care of her dad, Scott, after he underwent heart surgery, the pop star revealed details about her 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl — which Kelce had helped her announce to the world via a New Heights teaser clip the day prior to the full episode’s premiere — on the show. She also shared her side of the story of how Kelce won her over with his failed Eras friendship bracelet plot two years prior, something she jokingly called a “man tantrum.\n“He didn’t even reach out to our management,” Swift said on New Heights, laughing. “When this podcast came out, I was like, ‘Did he ever reach out to be, like, in the tents, or did we know he was in the building?’ He came with [Patrick Mahomes], and he thought that because he knows the elevator lady that he could talk to her about just getting down to my dressing room.\n“It felt more like I was in an ’80s John Hughes movie, and he was standing outside of my window with a boombox saying, ‘I want to date you! Do you want to go on a date with me? I made you a friendship bracelet! Do you want to date me?’” she added. “I was like, ‘If this guy’s not crazy, this is sort of what I’ve been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager.’”",

The limited editions are only available while supplies last until 1:59 p.m. ET on Wednesday (Aug. 20).\nAvailable in two colors — wintergreen onyx and violet shimmer — the marbled Shiny Bug vinyl records feature exclusive cover art depicting Swift wearing a dark, sparkly leotard with flared spikes and matching gloves. They also come with a full-size gatefold photograph of Swift, a double-sided foldout panel displaying a special poem she wrote for the set and a collection of exclusive photographs.\nTrending on Billboard\nThe news comes less than a week after the pop star announced The Life of a Showgirl — her 12th studio album — on Aug. 12, via a teaser clip for her interview on Jason and Travis Kelce’s New Heights podcast. The full episode featuring Swift arrived the following day, with the musician sharing more details about the LP — including its cover art, production team and tracklist — on the show and in an Instagram post.\n“[The album is] a lot more upbeat, and it’s a lot more fun pop excitement,” she said on the show. “My main goals were melodies that were so infectious, you’re almost angry at it.”\nWith Max Martin and Shellback serving as Swift’s only co-producers on Showgirl, the 12-track project features a collaboration with Sabrina Carpenter on the title track. At the time Swift first announced the LP last week, she also debuted four alternate versions of the album — the “Sweat and Vanilla Perfume” edition, the “It’s Frightening” edition, the “It’s Rapturous” edition and the “It’s Beautiful” edition — that each come with different artwork and photo cards, as well as a jewelry box with a different collectible charm bracelet.\nAs opposed to Swift’s last album, the sprawling 35-track Tortured Poets Department — which spent 17 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 — the singer has also promised that Showgirl will not have any bonus tracks beyond the core 12 on the tracklist.\n“There’s no other songs coming,” she emphasized on New Heights. “This is the record I’ve been wanting to make for a very long time.”",

Ferguson said the agency was sending a message to “unscrupulous middlemen who harm fans and jack up prices through anticompetitive methods.”\n“Today’s action puts brokers on notice that the Trump-Vance FTC will police operations that unlawfully circumvent ticket sellers’ purchase limits, ensuring that consumers have an opportunity to buy tickets at fair prices,” Ferguson said.\nIn a statement, Key Investment Group said it would “vigorously defend itself” against a “clear example of regulatory overreach.”\n“The case threatens to dismantle the secondary ticket market for live events, further consolidating power in the hands of the industry’s largest monopoly,” the group said.\nTicketmaster and parent company Live Nation were not named in the lawsuit nor accused of any wrongdoing.\nSwift’s Eras Tour wrapped in December with a record-shattering haul of more than $2 billion in face-value ticket sales over a two-year run. The unprecedented demand for the tickets led to a disastrous presale in November 2022 and then created an infamously pricey resale market throughout the run.\nIn Monday’s lawsuit, the FTC says Key Investment bought at least 10 tickets to 38 different Eras Tour concerts, paying a total of $744,970.29. It then resold them on the secondary market for $1,961,980.65, netting $1,217,010.36 in profit.\nAt just one concert — Taylor’s stop at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium in March 2023 — Key Investment allegedly used 49 different accounts to buy 273 tickets, a move the FTC says “dramatically exceeded” the six-ticket limit imposed by Ticketmaster.\nTo get around such limits, FTC says the group used “thousands of fictitious Ticketmaster accounts,” as well as proxy or spoofed IP addresses, virtual credit cards and fictitious names.\nNotably, the lawsuit claims the group also used so-called SIM banks — a device holding hundreds of cellphone SIM cards commonly used by scammers to send text messages from different phone numbers. The group allegedly used the banks to receive the unique verification codes sent by Ticketmaster to thwart the use of ticket-buying bots.\nMonday’s case was filed under the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, or BOTS Act, a 2016 statute that makes it illegal to use technology like bots to buy tickets en masse by skirting platform restrictions.\n“By circumventing Ticketmaster’s security measures, access control systems, or other technological controls or measures to buy tickets, and then selling or offering to sell the tickets, Defendants have violated and continue to violate the [BOTS] Act,” the lawsuit says.\nBut in its response statement, Key Investment Group said the lawsuit “twisted the intent” of the BOTS Act and turned it into “a weapon against legitimate businesses and consumers.”\n“Under the FTC’s interpretation, anyone who purchases more than four tickets or uses more than one account could be deemed in violation of federal law,” the group said. “That outcome is not only illogical, it is absurd.”\nKey Investment Group is an active member of the National Association of Ticket Brokers (NATB), the country’s largest trade lobby of ticket brokers and resellers.\nThe FTC complaint “highlights an important unresolved issue: How to clearly define what constitutes an illegal bot,” NATB’s head attorney, Gary Adler, tells Billboard in an email.\n“Since 2016, the line between innovative, widely available tools that facilitate secure transactions and software designed to cheat fans has remained blurred,” he continues, noting that “upcoming proceedings are an important opportunity to draw these distinctions for regulators, the industry, and consumers.”\nThis isn’t the first time that Swift’s infamously pricey tickets led to a crackdown. Earlier this year, New York prosecutors brought criminal charges against a “cybercrime crew” that allegedly stole more than 900 tickets to the Eras Tour and other events and then resold them for more $635,000 in illegal profit.",

October 13th??? And what will it sound like? Max Martin? We’re diving into everything we know!\nJason Lipshutz:\nIt’s funny because, as a longtime Taylor Swift fan, I’m still used to the every other year album releases. ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ was April 2024, I’m mentally like, “All right, see you 2025, maybe 2026.” The fact that we’re getting a new album this year is pretty remarkable.\nTetris Kelly:\nWell, with one Swift countdown clock and a teaser from her man Travis Kelce’s podcast, we’re officially in a new era. And her website listed the ship-by date for ‘The Life of a Showgirl’ as October 13th, so when can we expect it?\nJason Lipshutz:\nObviously, vinyl is gonna need some time to be produced and shipped and all that stuff. So maybe the album comes out in October. Maybe the album comes out on Friday. Who knows? Like, maybe we get a single on Friday and an album in September. You know, one thing that is worth noting is the deadline for Grammy eligibility is the end of August. So look, if we get a Taylor Swift album coming out this month, then it will be eligible at the 2026 Grammy Awards.\nTetris Kelly:\nShe also dropped a playlist featuring songs produced by her ‘1989’ hitmaker Max Martin.\nKeep watching for more!",

All right? She’s not giving you a remix. She’s not giving you a reboot. She’s like, it’s perfect. Enjoy it. People need to do that. Movies need to do that. TV shows need to do that. It’s perfect. Let it cook.\nTetris Kelly\nAll right team, so they are all Taylor’s Versions now. Taylor Swift has bought her masters back, you know, after all, the re-records. Billboard, we’re the people that reported she spent around $360 million to get it all back. How we feeling?\nEvan Burke\nI mean, that’s pocket change for her.\nTetris Kelly\nI mean, as a billionaire, you know…\nStefanie Tanaka\nPocket change, but I think it’s like, you know, it’s substantial, because not all artists hold their masters, and now she does, and this has been something that she’s been trying to do, and she has set out. She said, when she started her ‘Taylor’s Verison,’ this is something she set out to do, and if she had the opportunity to buy them, she would.\nJudy Sanchez\nI think it’s a total boss move, you know, and it really grabs, like, here she is taking control of her art and her music.\nTetris Kelly\nLike a group project, though, right?\nJerah Milligan\nYeah, wait. So she got the ones she re-recorded, but then she got the originals.\nTetris Kelly\nNow she owns the original.\nJerah Milligan\nSo now she got two sets of the same records.\nStefanie Tanaka\nSo under her new record deal with Republic, she owns her albums. So ‘Lover,’ ‘Folklore,’ ‘Evermore,’ ‘Midnights’ and ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ and all the Taylor’s Versions. She owns the rights to those, but her old, her old ones with her old label Big Machine Records, when they were bought out by UMG, she didn’t own those. So now she owns them all. She owns all the music videos, all the movies, everything she’s spent her whole life creating.\nWatch the full video above!",

Let us know in the comments below!\nTetris Kelly:\nDrake just grabbed his 14th No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with “$ome $exy $ongs 4 U” featuring PARTYNEXTDOOR, but outside of the memes we are definitely about to discuss, did you know that he now ties the record for most No. 1s ever on that chart ever with Jay-Z and Taylor Swift? We’re breaking down this historic feat. Just a few of Drake’s 14 chart toppers include ‘Take Care,’ ‘Views,’ and ‘Certified Lover Boy.’ Even after his current feud with Kendrick Lamar, he has captured the attention of the internet with the new album, returning to his Loverboy era. Drake was ready to move on. In “GIMME A HUG,” debuting at No. 6 on the Hot 100, he rapped – and “Nokia” did just that, debuting at No. 10. Both songs have been taking social media by storm with memes & TikTok renditions, with even Drake poking fun at his own lyrics by posting these. Drake now has 80 Hot 100 Top 10s, which is the most in history, leaving us asking, “Where the f**k the function?”\nAnd Taylor Swift herself also happens to be a fan of Drizzy, and the pop superstar has 14 of her own No. 1 albums including ‘Fearless,’ ‘Red,’ and ‘1989.’ And by releasing her older albums as “Taylor’s Version,” most of her albums have topped the chart twice. Iconic. The third in this record-holding trio is another hip hop icon is Jay Z.\nKeep watching for more!",
