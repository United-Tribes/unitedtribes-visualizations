It was created at a time when African music was on the cusp of becoming an increasingly large part of the Western pop culture landscape. Portions of it have been updated to reflect changes in the past five years-- particularly changes in the number of compilations and labels available. Unlike last week's article on contemporary sounds in West Africa, this one is largely devoted to reissue and cratedigging culture, to the great African music of the previous couple of generations.\nThe Africa 100 section, in which author Joe Tangari creates an imagined introduction to Afrobeat, highlife, and a few other large strains of African pop music has not had its selections altered; however, we have added Lala links to many of the entries.\nAfropop music is a sound and a movement, music and a state of mind. It's the joyous awakening of a continent from a colonial nightmare and the crushing realization that the nightmare isn't over yet, anguish and happiness whipped together with traditional drums, cheap guitars, and even cheaper amps.\nThis article isn't an attempt to tell the whole story of African music; it's an account of the time I've spent exploring the popular sounds of 1960s and 70s Africa. It's not the easiest music to fall deeply in love with, in part because it comes from a place most Westerners aren't close to understanding, a continent obscured by our misconceptions, prejudices, and expectations of \"world music.\" The other difficulties are more practical: The most fertile period for African funk, soul, rock, and jazz lasted from 1965 to 1982, a time of great upheaval in Africa, and much of this music wasn't recorded. Of that which was put to tape, if the masters still exist, they're likely significantly degraded by decades of neglect.\nFor what has been recovered, distribution can be spotty, and the shop that has two things you're looking for is usually missing four other things you want to check out. Compilers of these sounds must track down the musicians, hunt out masters in forgotten, crumbling pressing plants, and sift through bins of scratched, dusty vinyl in the markets of Accra, Conakry, and Lagos looking for the lost slab of brilliant funk or the 45 with the highlife A-side and the totally unexpected fuzz-rock B-side. The rewards of those efforts have been huge, though, and I'm pleased this music is increasingly getting the spotlight it deserves.\nFrom Sea to Shining Sea Music in West and East Africa (a disclaimer)\nAfropop was a wide-ranging phenomenon, but the primary geographic area I've been exploring extends from Senegal in West Africa, along the Atlantic coast to Nigeria and Cameroon, and then over to Ethiopia and Kenya, with a detour or two to South Africa. This is an immense area, and the flavor in each country is quite different, from Kenya's rough-and-tumble funk to South Africa's sleek sophistication to the wild experimentation of Ghanaian funk and fusion bands.\nThe decision to leave out most of Central and North Africa is partly practical and partly a matter of taste. The sound of central Africa is focused on variants of soukous, the Congolese form of Cuban rumba that dominated popular music there for much of the 20th century, and I haven't really had enough time to hear an appreciable amount of it. It also bears little resemblance to either Fela's Afrobeat or any other tangentially related African pop music. Similarly, topography-- namely the Sahara Desert-- separates Mediterranean Africa from the rest of the continent, and the culture there is more Arabic than African. Raï, Andaluse, and other North African styles are singular, and though a bit of cross-pollination is inevitable, it's really an altogether separate world.\nNB: For an introduction to soukous, try Franco (2), Tabu Ley Rochereau, and Mbilia Bel.\nHighlife Time A Bit of History\nAfropop is fusion music in the truest sense, incorporating elements of essentially any available source material. Loosely speaking, the Afrobeat of Fela and other early practitioners like Orlando Julius Ekemode was a modernization of the dance-band highlife that dominated the popular music of Anglophone African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria. Highlife was a general term given to several styles of music that were themselves fusions of Western ballroom and swing music, Trinidadian calypso, Liberian sailors' songs, palmwine guitar music (so called because of the drink imbibed at events where it was played), and-- most importantly-- local rhythms. The greatest highlife star was E.T. Mensah, whose tours of West Africa with his Tempos Band spread the music far and wide. He's credited with introducing it to Nigeria, and his concerts with Louis Armstrong are among the earliest seeds of Afrobeat.\nThese new musical hybrids emerged at the same time as the Civil Rights movement in the U.S. and the decolonization of Africa by European powers, beginning on March 6, 1957, with the independence of Ghana under the pan-Africanist Kwame Nkrumah. American jazz, soul, and funk became outlets for politics and expressions of black pride. James Brown visited the continent several times, and a listen to any Afrobeat compilation reveals his influence. By the end of the 60s, the optimism spurred by independence had dimmed considerably as some initially democratic governments calcified into autocratic regimes, as economies stagnated, militaries took power, and currencies plummeted in value. Nkrumah, a great thinker and activist, wasn't adept at governing and was overthrown in a coup in the wake of some disastrous economic policy decisions and a declaration of himself as president-for-life.\nIt was against this backdrop that Fela took his band, Koola Lobitos, to Britain and the U.S., where he read the writings of Malcolm X and befriended members of the Black Panthers. When he returned home, his band had been renamed Africa '70 and he embarked on the long, wild course of loud, unflinching criticism of corruption and ineptitude in African government that cemented his legend and kept the Nigerian authorities exasperated until his death from AIDS in 1997.\nFela Music Is the Weapon\nOverstating Fela's position in African music would be difficult, and in Afrobeat specifically it would be impossible-- his contemporaries lived in his shadow, and newspapers referred to him on a first-name basis. Fela frequently fought with Nigeria's military governments, believing that inept or cruel local government was no better than inept, cruel governance from abroad. In Stephane Tchal-Gadjieff and Jean Jacques Flori's great 1982 documentary Music Is the Weapon, Fela-- sitting in a tattered chair in his communal home-- expressed his belief that blacks oppressing blacks in Nigeria is worse than whites oppressing blacks in South Africa, because it's more insidious: It's more difficult to comprehend your oppression when the obviousness of racism is removed from the equation, he theorized.\nSo much has already been written about Fela that it seems fruitless to rehash his biography, as fascinating as it is. Though he made huge sums of money from his music, he chose to live in a dilapidated Lagos compound-- his Kalakuta Republic-- with his wives and band members, and he disdained the Nigerian elites who ignored the city's massive slums and rampant crime. He also saw Christianity and Islam as destroyers of an African way of life and predicated his lifestyle, including his controversial polygamy, on a return to African spirituality. His album art spills over with these ideas: The imams and priests on the cover of Shuffering & Shmiling lord over piles of money near the words \"Why Not African Religion?\", while he blows bubbles containing the words and phrases \"Pan-Africanism,\" \"Total Emancipation,\" \"Freedom,\" and \"Justice\" from his sax on the cover of No Agreement.\nFela sang most of his epic songs in pidgin English to reach as wide an audience as possible-- Nigeria's Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, and Fulani communities could all understand it, and it exported easily to other English-speaking countries. And of course, there's his sound: Eighteen-minute epics riding endless polyrhythmic grooves, massive horn sections and choirs, incessant guitar ostinatos, and Fela's furious baritone. The arrangements were intricate, but left room for the accomplished soloists of the Africa 70 and his later band the Egypt 80. Fela's stage presence was mesmerizing, whether he wore his lime-green or aqua blue jumpsuits or just his underwear, his pink, cowrie-shell encrusted sax glistening as it hung from his neck.\nSinging in pidgin English had other advantages for Fela, as he was a great lover of wordplay and fluently bilingual-- he claimed in an interview with guitarist Keziah Jones that English is Yoruba \"wrongly spoken.\" \"Society\" is just another way of spelling the Yoruba \"so si ayiti,\" loosely translated as \"tied in such a way that it appears free,\" he claimed. Often he was less subtle: The cover of his V.I.P. album has \"Very Important Persons\" crossed out and replaced with \"Vagabonds in Power\" and he repurposed the acronym of multinational information conglomerate I.T.T. to stand for \"International Thief Thief.\"\nFela's outspoken stance made his life difficult and often tragic. In 1975, police arrived at his house intending to plant marijuana on him and book him for possession, but he confounded them by eating the joint. When they arrested him to get an incriminating stool sample, he merely swapped with another prisoner and walked away a free man, detailing the whole ordeal on Expensive Shit. His 1977 album Zombie, a furious critique of the military, prompted an attack on his compound that destroyed his home and left his mother with fatal injuries. Instead of backing down, he delivered her coffin to an army barracks and wrote Coffin for Head of State, a scathing indictment of the militarys brutal repression. On his defiance in the face of tyranny, he had this to say in Music Is the Weapon: \"My name is Anikulapo... I can't die. They can't kill me.\" Fela replaced his given middle name Ransome with Anikulapo in the late 70s. Anikulapo means, roughly, \"he carries death in his pouch.\"\nAbout the only thing keeping Fela from a lifetime in prison was the instability of the Nigerian government itself. Whenever he was jailed, a new regime would release him when it came to power. He remained an activist to the end of his life, never compromising his beliefs or positions to accommodate anyone. It's said that more than a million people attended his funeral, but whatever the numbers, Fela was the king of Afrobeat, and no one else comes close to that claim.\nMore Than One Man's Music\nThough Fela obviously looms large over African music, there were literally hundreds of great African funk, soul, and rock bands, with incredible scenes in Ghana and Nigeria in particular. The modernization of West Africa's other great traditional music, Juju, was concurrent with Africa's funk explosion, and though Fela was revered by many, he was easily outsold by Nigerian Juju master King Sunny Adé, who released as many as 100 albums before he was ever heard on record outside of Africa, on 1982's Island/Mango album Juju Music. Nigeria, by virtue of having Africa's largest population (and a hugely diverse one at that) was a hotbed of new styles, from Orlando Julius' \"Super Afro Soul\"-- immortalized on his classic 1966 album of the same name-- to the deeply Islamic Hausa funk of Ofo the Black Company and Sahara All Stars Band Jos to the heavy, disco-informed groove of Fred Fisher and Thony Shorby Nyenwi.\nNigerians also had the benefit of a highly professional music industry, and Decca (and its subsidiary Afrodisia), EMI, and Polydor all had massive operations there. Ginger Baker, who had become a great friend of Fela's and often sat in on drums on his early-70s shows, built the 16-track ARC Studios in Ikeja, the first of its kind in Africa. It soon had competition.\nWhile money flowed well in Nigeria, things were more difficult in other countries. Ghana's music industry was a web of shoestring operations that succeeded solely due to the raw talent of those involved, while countries like Ivory Coast and Benin produced far fewer groups than their neighbors. (Although Benin's Orchestre Poly-Rythmo was one of West Africa's greatest bands.)\nIn Guinea, the music industry was controlled by the government of president Sekou Toure, who set up a system of regional orchestras. Cubano son and rumba heavily influenced the music of the West African coast, and most of the bands in Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau-- along with Mali, further inland-- played some local spin on it. In Guinea, the Orchestre de Beyla was so amazing that it was elevated to the status of national orchestra. Known from that point forward as Bembeya Jazz National, the band was remarkably innovative for a government-controlled entity, with guitarist Sekou Diabate's searing, psychedelic tone and the band's Afro-Cuban fusion so thoroughly mixed it became its own style.\nSenegal's Orchestra Baobab was Bembeya's greatest counterpart, but Gambia's Super Eagles-- who played a style of Afro-Cuban music called Ndagga that was a precursor to Youssou N'Dour and Etoile de Dakar's mbalax music-- briefly garnered a lot of notice for their Sgt. Pepper costumes and energetic stabs at deep soul and British Invasion rock. Many of the bands that recorded soul or funk singles or albums weren't exclusively soul or funk bands. Highlife and Afro-Cuban bands frequently wrote and recorded one-off stabs at Afrobeat or American soul, and groups like the Yahoos or Ghana's African Brothers Band released a slew of singles touching on just about every sound you could name. The resulting swirl of styles is exhausting to research and exhilarating to take in.\nAround the Horn Outside West Africa\nWhile Afrobeat was primarily a West African phenomenon, it put down roots elsewhere, with a few nearly unheard bands popping up in the Soukous strongholds of Congo and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). Zambia's Zamrock was largely indebted to the Congolese soukous sound, as well as South African township jive and mbaqanga, while Kenyan funk bands Matata and Mombasa were overshadowed by the popularity of the upbeat soukous offshoot benga. South Africa produced a number of remarkable funk bands, most arising from the prolific fusion and jazz scenes, but it was always peripheral music there.\nA limited number of African or part-African groups had success on other continents in the 60s and 70s, including Ghanaian/Caribbean prog-funk band Osibisa (the name means \"criss-cross rhythms that explode with happiness\"), based in London, whose albums were adorned with Roger Dean cover art. Exiled South Africans Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela, who were briefly married in the 60s, became minor stars on the U.S, folk and jazz scenes, respectively, while Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji's 1959 Drums of Passion album is widely regarded as the recording that created the world music industry. It's also the album that inspired countless jazz musicians to look to Africa for rhythmic inspiration, and was a direct influence on Coltrane's A Love Supreme, as well as Carlos Santana, who covered \"Jin-go-lo-ba\" and actually exerted a big influence on Afrobeat himself. And of course, there's Manu Dibango, the saxophonist/marimbist from Cameroon who recorded frequently in New York and scored a minor club hit (#72 R&B) with the tough funk track \"Soul Makossa\".\nNot surprisingly, Afrobeat had a huge influence on American funk in the 70s, and many Afrobeat compilations include American groups like Oneness of Juju and Lafayette Afro-Rock Band. Today, American groups such as New York's Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra, Kokolo, and Akoya Afrobeat Ensemble, and NOMO trade in Afrobeat. In Africa itself, the funk explosion died in the early 80s, killed by worsening economic conditions and the withdrawal of major Western record labels and their funding, which increasingly went to lighter Afropop fare and traditional recordings. By 1982, only two studios remained in Ghana: Ghana Films and the open-air Bokoor Studios, the last refuge of the country's electric highlife scene.\nToday, talk of so-called world music and even specific discussions of the history of music in individual countries tend to gloss over Afrobeat or ignore it entirely, something I feel is a reflection of how Westerners want to perceive the world more than anything else. The fact is that funk and psychedelia were worldwide movements, and black consciousness spanned the whole of the African diaspora, from Brazil and Peru to the U.S. to Jamaica, Britain, and of course Africa itself.\nÉthiopiques The Wonderful and Strange Soundworld of Swinging Addis\nOther local scenes produced distinctive sounds, but Ethiopia's \"Swinging Addis\" music scene of 1969-1975 developed in a place that was almost totally isolated from the rest of the world. One of the planet's oldest populated areas, Ethiopia was the only east African country never to be colonized. Apart from a brief, limited occupation by Mussolini's Italy, the country remained untouched by European mismanagement, and for most of the 20th century remained under the rule of Haile Selassie, the negus negast, or king of kings.\nEthiopia had no tradition of symphonic music and no real popular music to speak of in the immediate post-war era, but the country had adopted military marching bands, and Selassie's government kept tight control over the makeup and repertoire of the few institutional bands that did exist-- most of which were tied to the National Theater. Beginning in the late 1950s, the musicians and arrangers of these bands branched out and took steps toward incorporating Western sounds into their music. But it took all the way to the late 60s for this experimentation to find its way to the people, with the founding of the first independent bands. The institutional groups, like Police Band and Imperial Body Guard Band, diversified their sounds to compete, and Swinging Addis was born.\nThough record distribution by non-government entities was prohibited by a 1948 imperial edict, an enterprising young man named Amha Eshèté set up his own label, Amha Records, anyway and proceeded to document a period of incredible creativity and resourcefulness in the Ethiopian music community. Only one member of the entire scene, Mulatu Astatke, had received formal training in composition and arranging outside of Ethiopia. The only known Ethiopian vibraphonist, Astatke was a hugely important figure in Ethiopian music, arranging countless records and helping to craft the utterly distinctive \"Ethiopique\" sound, which has been well-documented in the last decade by France's Buda Musique Records, on a series by the same name.\nEthiopian music can probably best be described as dark, psychedelic funk and soul. It's as though a group of highly skilled musicians were told what funk, rock, soul, and jazz sounded like without hearing any examples and then went and played all of those styles at once on whatever instruments were around-- horns, vibes, electric organs, electric guitars, piano, harp; all of it was fair game. The singing is mostly done in a melismatic head voice, but you get the occasional James Brown grunt from Alemayehu Eshete (no relation to Amha) or a whispery, uncharacteristic singing style like that of Girma Beyene.\nThe Amha recordings have lo-fi warmth, but they're positively hi-fi compared to those on the Kaifa label, which rarely had the use of more than two microphones. The catalogues of Ethiopia's two local independent labels-- as well as that of Philips Ethiopia, the only foreign company to get significantly involved-- are a treasure trove of strange, inscrutable music that sounds like nothing else on the planet. Despite its uniqueness, it's mostly very accessible music to non-Ethiopians, and it's some of my favorite stuff.\nUnfortunately, the scene didn't last, and Haile Selassie's reign was brought to a brutal end with Mengistu Haile-Mariam's Soviet-supported coup in 1975. The curfews of the derg period, as Mengistu's reign became known, put the brakes on Swinging Addis, and several of the most important musicians went into exile, mostly in the U.S. Recording activity lingered on into the late 70s, but by the 80s, one of the world's most vital and vibrant music scenes had all but died.\n-=-=-=-Expensive Shit An Afropop Buyer's Guide\n__A Guide to Reliable Afropop Labels\n__\nWhen this piece first ran, access to African music in the United States looked a lot different than it does today. Partly, this has to do with the Internet (more on that later), but in the last several years, a number of labels have been established or entered the fray, digging up music from previously neglected locales. Interest has also skyrocketed, and the mark of African pop music has been stamped all over music from the West, from Vampire Weekend to Manu Chao to Gorillaz to West-meets-Africa groups such as the Very Best and Extra Golden. The global success of Amadou & Mariam, Konono No. 1, Tinariwen, Toumani Diabate, Rokia Traore, Oumou Sangare, and other artists has had plenty to do with rising interest as well. This aide for starting your explorations has been updated accordingly.\nWhether you're quickly sampling to satisfy your curiosity, expanding what you already know, or diving in head-first, you now have quite a few places to go to explore the music of Africa in all its many forms. Some releases are tougher to find than others and require virtual trips to specialty shops such as Dusty Groove, Honest Jon's, CDRoots, Boomkat, or Aquarius, it sometimes helps if you have a turntable, and you'll need to be able to open .rar files, but building a collection is within reach for anyone.\nMost African music is found in the U.S. on compilations, and these tend to go in and out of print as small boutique labels fold or bigger labels can't be bothered with keeping a low seller in print. There are a handful of very reliable labels, and there are also a few huge, general world music labels that offer African recordings in their vast catalogues. Here are a few to look out for:\nSoundway\nSimply put, Brighton, England's Soundway equals quality. The label is run by passionate people who do things the right way: Every track on a Soundway compilation is meticulously remastered, sometimes from vinyl if the masters aren't around anymore, and I've never noticed a drop in sound quality on any of its releases. More than that, the track selection on its multi-artist comps is nothing short of astounding and the label fills its liners with tons of information, including bits of input from the original artists when available. Its single-artist releases are equally rigorous and generally very comprehensive. Also, Soundway carefully licenses all of the music it releases, which is noble. They're branched out of Africa recently, releasing volumes of funky music from Columbia, Panama, and the French Caribbean, and their collections of Ghanaian and Nigerian pop music are uniformly excellent.\nAnalog Africa\nSamy Ben Redjeb's Analog Africa began as an attempt to resurrect old Zimbabwean music from the dawning days of Chimurenga. This yielded great volumes chronicling the Green Arrows and the Hallelujah Chicken Run Band but political and economic problems (to put it lightly) forced the label's eye elsewhere. It settles in the two small countries of Benin and Togo, sandwiched between Ghana and Nigeria on the underside of the West African bulge. Redjeb's entertaining liner notes usually take the form of a travelogue, with interviews with musicians, producers and label owners. He illuminates the process of finding the music as much as the music itself, and he's done a brilliant job of unearthing rare music by the eternal T.P. Orchestre Poly-Rythmo and some of the regions other major (and not so major) artists. You can't go wrong buying anything on this label.\nRetro Afric\nRetro Afric is a great UK label, usually specializing in slightly more traditional music. It's responsible for two great E.T. Mensah highlife compilations, a brilliant resurrection of a couple of LPs by Sierra Leonean funk master Geraldo Pino (Soundway concurrently reissued them on vinyl), the Super Eagles retrospective Senegambian Sensation, and a modest catalogue of interesting soukous records, including Vintage Verckys, a superb look at Congo's Orchestre Vévé, and sharp volumes on rumba master Franco and rumba rebel Gaby Lita Bembo. The label also has releases from Kenyan and Tanzanian artists, and a great retrospective of Zambia's Alick Nkhata, who worked for Zambian state radio in the 60s and made some truly wonderful music.\nOriki Music\nGenerally great stuff from Mali and Senegal, including a fabulous retrospective of Senegal's ageless Orchestra Baobab, and looks at Malian giants Kante Manfila, Sorry Bamba, and Moussa Doumbia. My favorite release of theirs is a stunning collection of lengthy tracks by Mali's Super Rail Band, led by guitarist Djelimady Tounkara.\nSublime Frequencies\nThis label has a real field recordist's aesthetic, and has releases documenting everything from a stash of Cambodian pop music cassettes found in an American library to recordings of North Korean state radio, plus straightforward compilations of Iraqi, Burmese, and Thai music and collages of Sumatran pop radio call-in shows. Its forays into Africa have mostly focused on the wild guitar music of the Sahara-- the unfiltered recordings of bands from Niger and Western Sahara. And if you've ever enjoyed a punk record, you likely won't need much context to enjoy Western Sahara's Group Doueh or Niger's Group Bombino and Group Inerane. The label also has a couple of DVDs of this stuff out, and a great compilation of early Algerian raï music. For other field recordings, Drag City's Yaala Yaala imprint has issued several volumes of field recordings made in Malian villages over the past few years.\nAfrostrut/Strut/Harmless\nStrut has ping-ponged from triumph to tragedy to triumph again. Forced into liquidation in 2003, the label was the best going during its too-brief original run. Much of the label's early catalog is still unavailable, but Strut came back with a vengeance in the last few years with a couple of great compilations of Nigerian and South African music. Their Nigeria 70 compilation was one of the first truly substantial Western retrospectives of African funk, and Ethio-jazz pioneer Mulatu Asatqe now records for the label. You may also know them from their Disco Not Disco compilations.\nSavannahphone\nA bit of an enigma-- the label’s once-authoritative website has vanished and its releases tend to come out in small collector runs. So far, they've released two volumes of very old Nigerian recordings dating from the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, and last year became the first label to take a serious look at the dance bands of Burkina Faso with the compilation Ouaga Affair: The Hard Won Sound of Upper Volta 1974-1978.\nPopular African Music\nThis label has been at it for quite a while-- try not to be discouraged by their archaic website, which promises a new site and shop in 2003-- and its released a number of interesting records, largely focused on the Cuban-influenced sounds of Africa. It released a volume of Poly-Rythmo's most Cubanized music, has volumes on artists from Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, and the two Congos, as well as a reissue of Burkinabe artist Amadou Balake's classic album Taximen.\nOriginal Music\nThis label is something of a legend. Established in the late 1960s by John Storm Roberts, it built an eccentric and impressive catalog of music from around the world, including the brilliant collection Africa Dances, the amazing Giants of Highlife compilation, a volume of urban music from Somalia, recordings of miners' songs from Zaire, Zambia, and Malawi, and a ton of other music from Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria, South Africa, Cameroon, Benin, and Ivory Coast, among others. This label was decades ahead of its time, and its releases are lost in out-of-print oblivion, but if you ever happen to find one, snap it up. The web is your most reliable source for Original Music, if you can figure out where to find them. Most of the label's releases made it to CD at one point or another, and they can be tracked down. Other titles to search for: Azagas & Archibogs and Money No be Sand.\nHeritage\nHeritage is a boutique label that's part of a family of imprints specializing in early recordings. It’s responsible for a few gems, including a collection of recordings by the West African Instrumental Quintet made in London in 1929, and a retrospective on early juju artist Domingo Justus.\nSWP\nWhat Harry Smith was to American folk music, Hugh Tracey was to the traditional music of Southern and Central Africa. He collected a vast treasure trove of recordings from throughout the region, many of them documenting styles and moments long since lost to the sands of time. He founded the International Library of African Music in Grahamstown, South Africa, in 1954, and a lot of his recordings were released on the extensive Music of Africa series of 10-inch LPs. SWP is essentially the modern curator of the collection, building it into well-considered volumes and re-releasing it on CD. I can't say enough about the brilliance of the music captured on their Bulawayo Jazz volume, which collects recordings of big horn bands from Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) made in the 1950s. There was a finite window in which to capture that music, and Tracey was there, giving it to future generations.\nBuda Musique\nParisian label Buda Musique is one of the world's great imprints, with a massive back catalog stretching from traditional tribal music to the outstanding, ongoing Éthiopiques series. You want liner notes? The liners in a Buda Musique release cannot be beat. Full track notes, biographical information, historical context... it's all there, along with tons of photographs and lyrics translated from their original languages into English and French. The remastering is always amazing, although sometimes the sources are not easy to work with. The five-part Angola series is also intriguing, covering Angolan popular music from the entire post-war era, with each volume covering a different span of years.\nShanachie\nShanachie is another label with an unfathomable back catalogue, and it has released such a wide variety that you never really know exactly what you're getting, though the quality is likely to be high. It's no good for an off-the-cuff purchase-- I've wound up with a few records that were really not my kind of thing-- but if you've done your research, you'll be treated with good sound and usually lots of information. Shanachie keeps its back catalogue in print on its website, and I highly recommend Alemayehu Eshete's 1992 album Addis Ababa, one of a very few post-1975 Ethiopian records to gain wide release.\nSterns/Earthworks\nYet another behemoth, Sterns and its Earthworks subsidiary have labyrinthine catalogs that require research. The labels' outputs are too diverse to assume you know what you're getting, but there are a lot of great releases. The Sterns Africa reissues of Orchestra Baobab's early 80s albums are great, and anything that say The Syliphone Years on it is worth buying-- these releases document the great bands of Guinea in the 60s and 70s, and the Bembeya Jazz and Balla et ses Balladins volumes are especially great. The label's recent Congolese collections of music by Tabu Ley Rochereau (the Voice of Lightness) and Franco (the two Francophonic volumes) are superb. Earthworks is responsible for bringing South Africa's township music to light on the epochal 1985 compilation The Indestructible Beat of Soweto.\nHonest Jon's\nDamon Albarn's gem of a label has stepped up its African music game lately. Its early African output included a double reissue of two albums by Fela sidemen Tunde Williams and Lekan Animashaun, along with the excellent Mali Music. Since then, the four-volume London Is the Place For Me shined a light on African and Caribbean music recorded in London during the mid-20th century, Lagos Chop Up and Lagos All Routes collected highlife, juju and apala tracks, and last year's trio of releases, Marvellous Boy, Africa Boogaloo and World Is Shaking, paint a diverse picture of African styles as they evolved in West and Central Africa in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s.\nAnd Elsewhere…\nObviously, there are tons of other labels, many of them majors, who have at least dabbled in Afrobeat. Rough Guides can be a mixed bag, but it also uncovers some interesting things and is worth a listen. I've checked a bunch of them out of my local library. The best I've heard are the Ethiopia volume (it borrows heavily from the Éthiopiques series) and retrospectives of Youssou N'Dour & Etoile de Dakar and Manu Dibango. Labels like Naxos World and Nonesuch Explorer tend to be focused on a more ethnomusicological mission, but the quality is always tops, and World Village is starting to break groups like the great Saharan guitar band Tinariwen.\nVampisoul has recently thrown itself into Africa with a great deal of enthusiasm if not focus, and if you looks in the right places, you'll find small gems like Rounder's great Juju Roots compilation and the two Africa-focused volumes of Yazoo's Secret Museum of Mankind series, which focuses on antiquarian recordings taken from 78s and mixes popular and traditional styles freely.\nSmaller labels like Afrodisiac and Evolver released interesting comps early in the 2000s, but subsequently vanished (Afrodisiac's lack of liners is infuriating, too). And of course there's always David Byrne's Luaka Bop, whose African forays have been few so far, but whose releases are usually up to high standards. Their World Psychedelic Classics 3: The Funky, Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa is a great comp. Also worth mentioning is Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra's Ropeadope label, which has an interesting stable of artists, though it's not wholly focused on the revival Afrobeat sound that the band does so well.\nEssential Recordings\nThis is a list of 12 releases that would make what I view to be the perfect introductory Afropop collection, with a few notes on each (extensive notes on some of the tracks are in the mix that follows).\nFela Kuti: Expensive Shit [Editions Massoka; 1975; to be reissued in 2010 by Kntting Factory]\nFela released more than 50 albums in his tumultuous lifetime and approaching his catalogue is intimidating to say the least. To put a broad point on it, his most fertile period was the latter half of the 1970s, but it's genuinely difficult to come across a Fela record that doesn't make the grade. Thankfully, Fela is also the exception that proves the rule: Thanks to an extensive and extremely well-done reissue campaign by MCA/Universal (since repeated and improved by the great Chicago-based Wrasse label and continued this year by Knitting Factory), nearly all of Fela's recordings are currently available with great sound, original artwork, and good liners.\nMost albums are paired with another, and albums that get their own disc always include a few previously unreleased extras. I started with Expensive Shit/He Miss Road, a twofer of 1975 albums, and if I had it to do over, I'd start there again, because it's a great introduction to Fela's big sound and epic track lengths. Consisting of five tracks, all more than 10 minutes long, it's a monster disc, and though \"Expensive Shit\" is phenomenal, the original LP flip side \"Water No Get Enemy\" is even better, one of Fela's best tracks. For a second Fela disc, you can't go wrong with Zombie, a powerhouse record and a defining moment for Afrobeat.\nGhana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway; 2003]\nThere is no weak track among the 14 gems of Ghanaian funk here, some seeing release for the first time ever, and many of them are among my absolute favorite songs. Unremittingly funky and covering a ridiculous breadth of sounds and approaches, this is not to be missed. Volume 2 is almost equally amazing, and last year's double-disc Ghana Special set plunges far deeper into the scene to illuminate a ton of great, long-lost music.\nNigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut; 2002]\nWhen this article originally ran, this was out of print, but it's since been remastered and reissued, and you're well advised to take advantage of your second chance. This covers the full range of Nigerian funk and soul in the 70s, from Fela's early progressive highlife to ultra-heavy Hausa funk to the funky psychedelia of Blo and Joni Haastrup. Two discs packed solid with outstanding music and a beautiful, informative book of liners apparently weren't enough, though, as the compilers included a third disc of audio documentaries about Fela, Afrobeat, Ginger Baker (the interview with him is downright hilarious), and Nigeria in the 70s. The revived Strut followed this set up with the Lagos Jump sequel, and that one broadens the panorama to include more highlife and jazz-based material.\nÉthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\nVolumes 1 and 3 are excellent and cover the same period and different songs by many of the same artists, but Éthiopiques 8 is perfect from front to back. Girma Beyene's \"Ene Negn Bay Manesh\" gets things going with an entrancing horn arrangement, but the music here is all over the map, from Lemma Demissew's Fats Domino-ish piano rock to Ayalew Mesfin's biting garage funk, with plenty of points in between. This disc makes a good case that Addis Ababa had one of the best scenes in the world from 1969-1975. Éthiopiques has many volumes devoted to the era's biggest stars, and really any of the Golden Age-focused sets are worth your investment. The label has also launched a sister series called Zanzibara, which collects period recordings from the Kenyan and Tanzanian coastal cities, as well as some modern recordings of Taraab music.\n*\nAfro-Baby: The Evolution of the Afro-Sound in Nigeria 1970-79* [Soundway; 2005]\nFirst, Soundway unearthed a mother lode in Ghana, and now it's meticulously working on Nigeria. The songs here range from spare, almost traditional-sounding funk to thumping, gritty disco, with an especially nice early Fela track. Liners are superb, and though the label apologizes for having to master certain songs from vinyl sources, you'd have to be listening with a stethoscope to notice. Afro-Baby never got a second volume, but the label did us three better with its three superb Nigeria Special compilations, which respectively cover highlife, rock and disco in 70s Nigeria.\nOrlando Julius & His Modern Aces: Super Afro Soul [Phonogram Nigeria; 1966; r: Strut/r: Vampi Soul]\nThis is a defining album, and one of the first African pop records to break away from the highlife/Juju/soukous molds. Strut's reissue is simple and informative and crucially adds the \"Ijo Soul\" and \"Olulofe\" singles, defining pieces of African pop. It's said that \"Ijo Soul\" helped inspire James Brown's late 60s material, and it's not hard to believe it. It's now back in print again thanks to Vampi Soul.\nLegends of Benin: Afro-Funk/Cavacha/Agbadja/Afro-Beat [Analog Africa, 2009]\nThis compilation focuses on four greats of Beninois music: Gnonnas Pedro, Antoine Dougbe, Honore Avolonto, and El Rego. Along with the label's African Scream Contest collection, it's a head-spinning introduction to some of the funkiest, toughest sounds on the planet. What the musicians of Benin and Togo lacked in resources they made up for with creativity, developing a wealth of funky sub-styles that played off of local rhythms and amped up the imported Cuban rhythms that had become a part of the local music.\nBembeya Jazz National: The Syliphone Years [Sterns Africa; 2005]\nGuinea's Bembeya Jazz were one of the greatest dance orchestras of West Africa, and though only a few of their songs really sound like Afrobeat, their music was so unique it definitely fits the spirit. I can't say enough about guitarist Sekou Diabate's sinuous playing, but the rhythm section deserves equal props for creating a mysterious, thrumming vibe for the horns to soak in. The 2xCD compilation focuses on their early recordings, which have a beguiling, room-sound ambience that's easy to get lost in. The subsequent set centered on Balla et ses Balladins is nearly as great, as is the various artist Authenticité set.\nÉthiopiques 4: Ethio Jazz & Muzique Instrumentale 1969-1974 [Buda Musique]\nThis Éthiopiques volume concentrates on Mulatu Astatqe's instrumental music, and it's a trip. The textures on this record, drawn mostly from two different albums released in the early 70s, are out of this world, and the funk is deep, dark, and full of rough edges and unexpected twists. Strut released its own Mulatu disc last year, and it's even better, ranging more widely through his discography, with just a bit of overlap.\nT.P. Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou: Four releases\nThe band's name expanded and contracted from album to album (they released dozens of them) and single to single (no one seems to know exactly how many of those they released), but regardless of how the sleeve referred to them, Poly-Rythmo were one of Africa's (and the world's) greatest bands. There are four releases available in the West: Sound Way's Kings of Benin Urban Groove, which focused on their funkiest, almost disco-fied work; Popular African Music's Reminiscin' In Tempo, which collects some of their best Afro-Cuban and highlife tracks; and two superb volumes from Analog Africa. The Vodoun Effect collects tough-as-nails funk tracks recorded on lo-fi set-ups for a scattering of tiny labels, while Echos Hypnotiques covers hi-fi funk recorded at EMI's studios in Nigeria for the powerhouse Albarika Store label. My personal favorite is The Vodoun Effect, but you can choose where to start based on how your tastes run.\nLove, Peace & Poetry: African Psychedelic Music [Normal/QDK Media, 2004]\nCazumbi: African 60s Garage, Vol. 1 [No Smoke, 2009]\nGoing off the beaten track a bit here, these compilations both gather psychedelic rock music from around Africa, and are pretty much your only sources on that front at the moment. The Love, Peace & Poetry series has done this for many different parts of the world, and while the releases look incredibly cheesy (I'm not sure what go-go dancer and Playboy model Cheryl Shrode has to do with African, Turkish or Chilean psych, but she's on all the covers), the assortment of music is really fun, and well outside even the ever-expanding box these efforts usually work in. The mixture of white South African acts and black acts from several countries is interesting, too. Also mixing black and white is Cazumbi, a superlative collection of rough-and-tumble garage rock, jerk and twist from South Africa, Mozambique, Angola and Zaire-- this one focuses on lower-fidelity material, with lots of chunky surf riffs and youthful abandon. I haven't heard the second volume yet, but aim to soon.\nSurfing Afropop\nWhen this article was originally written, the blogosphere hadn't yet taken much of a stab at African music, but what a difference a few years makes. Discographies are slowly making their way online, and there are now a great many places to sample music that's been otherwise unavailable for ages, or at the very least difficult-to-impossible to find in the West. This is a shortlist of the best places to go to listen and learn:\nVoice of America's African Music Treasures\nAn outgrowth of VOA's long-running Music Time In Africa program, launched by Leo Sarkisian in 1965, this incredible blog has access to reels and reels of tapes from all over Africa, and a huge library of 45s, LPs, cassettes and CDs that reach into just about every corner of music-making on the continent. Blogger Matthew LaVoie doesn't post every day or every week. This is because he actually researches every post in painstaking detail, often referencing interviews of the musicians, or when none present themselves, interviewing them himself. He's addressed countries like Somalia, Uganda, Sao Tome & Principe, Mauritania, Liberia and Malawi that don't usually get much attention. You will learn something from every post.\nWorld Service\nA great blog for the more old-school, less funk/rock-oriented stuff, this blog posts intensely detailed and broadly knowledgeable entries on music from just about everywhere in Africa. It's about as well-run as a blog based on a private passion and not operated for profit can be.\nLikembe\nSimilar to WorldService, this is a wide-ranging blog that knows its stuff and posts broadly across genres and regions. The blogger, John B., frequently seeks out and provides translations of lyrics and helps the reader understand the context of the music they're hearing. A good job all around.\nVoodoo Funk\nThe travelogue of a DJ named Frank who lived in Guinea for a few years, this blog's archives are loaded with gargantuan mixes of some of the hardest-to-find West African funk. Good stories about record hunting in Africa abound.\nOro\nA great blog that's mostly tuned in on Benin, this place is Poly-Rythmo heaven, and also good for getting a full panorama of Beninois music, from hard funk to Afro-Cuban to Vodoun ritual music.\nAduna\nYou'll need to fire up Google Translator to get the information (it's in French), but he posts a good assortment of music from Francophone Africa, with a particular focus on Senegal.\nAwesome Tapes From Africa\nJust what it says. It's mostly West African music, and runs the gamut from half-hour recordings of griot story-songs to casio-coated rap and rough highlife.\nGlobal Groove\nThe blogger here is not always knowledgeable about what he's posting, but his intentions are good, the music is hot, and he's up front when he needs help with the research. He posts stuff from Latin America, Jamaica and elsewhere, too, and he posts a lot.\nHighlife Haven\nAn occasional highlife gem pops up here. It offers little context and challenges you to take the music at face value.\nAfro Slabs\nTruthfully, you don't go here to learn a thing-- this blogger, who lives somewhere in Cornwall, rips and posts out-of-print African LPs without so much as a word about them. The research is up to you if you hear something you like.\n///\nThese aren't updated on a regular basis, or at least tend to go silent for ages at a time, but they're all worth a look. Go for the archives:\nComb & Razor: Some great music, mostly in a funky vein. The blogger, Uchenna, grew up in Calabar, Nigeria and often relates stories from his youth, providing personal insight into why he loves some of the ultra-cheesy Nigerian synth-pop he occasionally posts. It's a great read, and his retrospective of Michael Jackson-inspired album covers is well worth a look.\nSea Never Dry: Infrequent but great posts of rare music, with concise bu informative background information.\nNo Condition Is Permanent: This was one of the first blogs to focus on African music, and it comes and goes, but it's worth checking out for the detail of its posts.\n-=-=-=-Africa 100 Track-by-Track\nNote: This compilation was created in April 2005. We've not changed the tracklisting, although five years later we surely would make some tweaks, because it still serves its purpose-- as an excellent introduction to African music.\nIf you're knee-deep in funk records, you have to test them on the road, so I made seven mix CDs for the car-- 99 tracks and over nine hours of music, plus a vinyl-only bonus track make up this mix. Only two of these songs aren't by African musicians-- Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra's \"Big Man\" and Kokolo's \"Mister Sinister\" may be by American bands, but they fit too well to deny them a place on these discs. I've offered some notes on every track, along with country of origin and year of production, when it's available to me. I've also tried to note many of the places the song has appeared up on records available outside of Africa. Enjoy.\n101. Fela Anikulapo Kuti & Africa '70: \"Zombie\" [Nigeria, 1977]\nAvailable on Zombie [MCA/Universal], The Best Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal], Music Is the Weapon: The Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal] and Black Man's Cry [Shanachie], and Best of the Black President [Knitting Factory]\n\"Zombie\" is top-flight Afrobeat, with Fela at the peak of his powers and Africa '70 sharp as daggers. The interlocking guitars stay on the same ostinato for more than 12 minutes as the horns surge around them. Fela's brilliant arrangement is full of unexpected gaps, blindsiding avalanches of sax, a hypnotic choir, and manic energy. His baritone growl drips with spite for Nigeria's junta and its loyal army, but he still injects biting humor when he wraps up the first verse by singing, \"Zombie no go turn unless you tell him to turn/ Zombie no go tinkle unless you tell him to tinkle.\"\nThe verses grow increasingly frantic as the song progresses, building to Fela's wild drill sergeant commands: \"Fall in!/ Fall out!/ Fall down!/ Get ready!\" Tony Allen's brilliant drumming deserves a blurb to itself-- the kick drum is almost completely independent from everything else he's doing, and he accents so many strange parts of the beat that it's a wonder he even knows where he is, but without his technique, the song wouldn't get anywhere. The Africa '70 was coming apart at the seams in 1977, but you can't tell as Fela leads the band into the final swell with a mocking rendition of \"Reveille\". Some protest music skirts around the issue with poetics or makes whining pleas for generic change; \"Zombie\" hits like a satirical hammer you can dance to. Perfect and absolutely essential.\n__102. Girma Beyene: \"Set Alamenem\" [Ethiopia, 1969]\n__Available on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\nThis is the sound of smoke wafting through the air in some Addis Ababa nightspot-- you can almost hear the drinks clinking in the background. The organ could have fit on Pink Floyd's A Saucerful of Secrets, but the song's dark, luxuriant sprawl is different from a traditional understanding of psychedelia-- it's altered states via ancient Coptic churches carved in solid stone, with the bass strangely mixed almost as high as the vocals. Beyene's whispered vocal delivery burns with quiet intensity and Mulatu Astatque's vibes wrap them in dense, unhurried atmosphere.\n103. Marijata: \"Mother Africa\" [Ghana, 1976]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway] and Pat Thomas Introduces Marijata [Gapophone]\nThis is about as thick and pure as funk gets, a sweet syncopated horn arrangement riding a hard groove, some tasteful lead guitar, and a bit of solo trading. It could give the J.B.'s a good run for their money any day. I'd get into the intricacies of the composition or something, but really, this just slams, and there's nothing better in the world to drive to.\n104. Segun Bucknor & His Revolution: \"La La La\" [Nigeria, year unknown]\nAvailable on Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut] and Poor Man No Get Brother: Assembly & Revolution 1965-1975 [Strut]\nStrut's amazing Bucknor retrospective went out of print when the label went out of business, but he deserves another look. \"La La La\" is a simple soul number with a booming bassline and catchy \"la la la\" chorus, but Bucknor's delivery of the lines \"My heart is filled with rain/ All I've got is shame\" is devastating.\"\n105. Oscar Sulley & the Uhuru Dance Band: \"Bukom Mashie\" [Ghana, 1973]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nThere aren't many songs where just the drum fill is awesome, but this is one of them. A clattering pile of percussion starts at a frantic tempo, and then that simple fill ushers in a staggering bass line. Saxophones dart from side-to-side avoiding stabbing, voluminous horns; the funky beat swings, bobbing up and down like a car with soft suspension. Sax and flute solos and chanting vocals are all swept up in Sulley's wild arrangement, a sort of miniaturized take on Fela's cinemascope big-band funk.\nIt's amazing that it was never released until 2003, when the Soundway folks scooped the weathered masters off a pressing plant shelf. Sulley later led Ghana's national symphony orchestra and taught percussion to poor children in Accra.\n106. Geraldo Pino: \"Heavy Heavy Heavy\" [Sierra Leone, year unknown]\nAvailable on Afro-Rock, Volume 1 [Evolver]\nSierra Leone's Geraldo Pino was one of the first successful West African musicians to pattern himself on American soul and funk, touring with his Heartbeats band across the region and inspiring dozens of young bands. \"Heavy Heavy Heavy\" is just that-- heavy funk full of slamming kick drum, deep bass and whirring organ that rockets along, modulating unexpectedly for the choruses. It's a crime that this is the only Pino track available.\n107. Super Eagles: \"Love's a Real Thing\" [Gambia, 1972]\nAvailable on Viva Super Eagles [Decca], World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing, The Funky Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa [Luaka Bop], Senegambian Sensation [Retro Afric]\nGambia's Super Eagles were one of many West African bands who specialized in an older style of music that tried their hand at rock, funk, or soul, and \"Love's a Real Thing\" is a fantastic slice of psychedelic soul that earns the Sgt. Pepper's uniforms they were famous for wearing. More typically, they played a style called Ndangga, a Cuban-influenced precursor to Youssou N'Dour and Etoile de Dakar's mbalax music, but the layered lead vocals and screaming chorus of this song make for their finest moment to my ears.\n108. Orlando Julius & His Modern Aces: \"Ijo Soul\" [Nigeria, 1966]\nAvailable on Super Afro Soul [Strut]\nOrlando Julius' Super Afro Soul is a milestone of African popular music and is said to have influenced some of James Brown's late 60s output. Listening to this contemporaneous single, which Strut helpfully appended to the album on their excellent reissue, it's hard not to notice the structural similarity to Brown's \"I Feel Good\", or the fact that one of the horn riffs essentially predicts Sam & Dave's \"Soul Man\". This is good-time early African funk and one of the most important songs that almost nobody's ever heard.\n109. Matata: \"Talkin' Talkin'\" [Kenya, 1974]\nAvailable on AfricaFunk: The Original Sound of 1970s Funky Africa [Harmless]\nSweet mother popcorn, funk does not get any grittier than this. The bass and drums are tough as rawhide and the lead vocal is a dirty, filthy, nasty delight. The thousand-watt horns blare so brightly you can feel the air passing over the curved brass. Kenya only produced a few notable funk bands in the 70s, but Matata were truly world-class.\n110. Ayalew Mesfin: \"Hasabe\" [Ethiopia, 1973]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\nThere's no sense beating around the bush: This song rips, with a nasty fuzz guitar riff presaging a filthy funk throwdown full of stabbing horns and Mesfin's uniquely Ethiopian vocals. The rhythm guitarist is sick on this track-- to think that this came from a government-controlled orchestra is mindblowing.\n111. Super Mambo 69: \"Sweeper Soul\" [Congo, 1972]\nAvailable on Afro-Rock, Vol. 1 [Evolver]\nI've heard it said that Super Mambo weren't typically a soul band, but you'd never know it from listening to this frantic rocker. The song's funky undercarriage is like some sort of perpetual motion machine, and the track gains energy as it goes along, the barking vocals piling up on top of light-speed guitars. The weirdest thing about it is the lead guitar, though, which sounds like it's being piped in from Neptune, dripping in reverb and tremolo.\n112. Babatunde Olatunji: \"Jin-Go-Lo-Ba\" [Nigeria, 1959]\nAvailable on Drums of Passion [Columbia/Legacy]\nPeople are more likely to know this one from Santana's cover version, but Olatunji's traditional version is every bit as thrilling, despite coming up much shorter on ingredients. You could say the most important ingredient isn't even one you'd find in the liner notes, and that's enthusiasm. Well, enthusiasm and rhythm. Gobs of ecstatic, unstoppable rhythm.\nDrums of Passion is the record that many credit with inaugurating the \"world music\" industry, and it was hugely influential in jazz circles, turning luminaries like John Coltrane, Pharoah Sanders, and Miles Davis on to the music of their ancestors.\n113. Dick Khoza: \"African Jive\" [South Africa, 1976]\nAvailable on Afrika Underground Jazz, Funk & Fusion Under Apartheid [Counterpoint] and Afro-Funk Explosion: Motherload from the Motherland [Explosive Entertainment]\nSomething about South Africa makes the music it produced in the 70s very different from the rest of the continent. Apartheid was no doubt a part of it, but I think money was a bigger part-- the South African music industry was much better-funded than those in other African countries. As a result, even speedy funk like Khoza's \"African Jive\" has a smoothness that can be off-putting. The scrappy guitars, floods of Fender Rhodes, and blaring horns on this instrumental do plenty to offset that, though, as does the track's overwhelming kinetic energy.\n114. Orchestra Baobab: \"Mouhamadou Bamba\" [Senegal, 1980]\nAvailable on Bamba [Sterns Africa] and The Rough Guide to the Music of Senegal and Gambia [Rough Guides]\nUsually, Baobab were one of the best of the West African Afro-Cuban dance bands, but this title track from their 1980 album, named for a revered Islamic figure (Bamba was the founder of the Mouride sect and is esteemed before Mouhammed by many in West Africa), is a brooding slab of hip-deep psychedelic funk coated in Barthelemey Attisso's shimmering, volcanic lead guitar. The vocals are layered and deeply reverent, floating in leagues of reverb.\n115. Os Bongos: \"Kazukuta\" [Angola, 1974]\nAvailable on Angola 70s: 1974-1978 [Buda Musique]\n\"Kazukuta\" is the name of a traditional Angolan carnival dance, but this is one of the few Angolan tracks I've heard that incorporates experimental elements. OK, \"experimental\" is perhaps a bit of stretch, but it is incredibly odd nonetheless to hear a bizarre interlude like the reverb and delay-drenched vocal pile-up that dominates the middle of this song, which is unusually funky for Angola to begin with. A curiosity perhaps, but a very good one.\n116. Getatchew Mekurya: \"Yegenet Muziqa\" [Ethiopia, 1972]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 14: Getachew Mekurya, Negus of Ethiopian Sax [Buda Musique]\nGetatchew was something of an oddity in Ethiopia's Swinging Addis era, and that's really saying something. His saxophone style is based on an improvised, melismatic Ethiopian war chant called Shellela. The result is something akin to Albert Ayler, but with the strange underpinning rhythms and electric organ of Ethiopian funk backing it up. Mekurya played in several of Ethiopia's orchestras and is heard backing the country's big stars on numerous recordings, but his solo material is some of the most unique music in the world.\n201. Brigth Engelberts & the B.E. Movement: \"Get Together\" [country unknown, 1978]\nAvailable on Booniay!!: A Compilation of West African Funk [Afrodisiac]\nAbout the only thing I know about Brigth Engelberts is that he was one funky dude. I can't find any decent information on the guy or his band, but \"Get Together\" is a solid rocket ride from the opening horn fanfare all the way to its final reprise. The guitar and sax solos are sweet and economical, but it's the weird, ring-modulated analog synth solos and interjections that give the instrumental its strange, quasi-futuristic edge.\n202. Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra: \"Big Man\" [United States, 2004]\nAvailable on Who Is This America? [Ropeadope]\nOn 2004's Who Is This America?, Antibalas began to move beyond an easy tag as near-religious Africa '70 revivalists, and this is one of their best songs to date. The New York band have so thoroughly subsumed Fela's aesthetic into their collective being that they're now building on it, and \"Big Man\" is a masterful casting of the class divide between rich and poor in terms the king of Afrobeat would no doubt appreciate.\nFela was never afraid to criticize the very people he was speaking in favor of, and likewise, Antibalas aren't afraid to admit that consuming the products that enrich the wealthy helps keep them in power. The groove is feisty and the playing rich in detail-- it would be easy to simply imitate vintage Afrobeat and come up with something halfway decent, but these guys are the real deal.\n203. Oscar Sulley & the Uhuru Dance Band: \"Olufeme\" [Ghana, 1973]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nAnother Sulley track from the vaults, and I hope there are a lot more where it came from. The massive horn arrangement sways and dives like a ton of bricks set teetering on a precipice, while Sulley's vocals belt with rough soul. Uhuru Dance Band was a long-running, successful dance orchestra specializing in highlife, but as this and their own recordings without Sulley (they were a band in their own right from the mid-60s to mid-80s) attest, they were hugely versatile. Sulley, meanwhile, deserves a volume to himself if there's enough material to fill it.\n204. Thony Shorby Nyenwi: \"No Wrong Show\" [Nigeria, 1978]\nAvailable on Afro Baby: the Evolution of the Afro Sound in Nigeria 1970-1979 [Soundway]\nIn spite of Nyenwi's understated, wah-drenched \"Voodoo Chile\" guitar intro, it's all about the beat on this one. The scratchy guitars and thumping drums do all of the heavy lifting for his odd, slurred vocal, and it's the kind of thing that probably would have been sampled about 80 times by now were it not for its total obscurity. Disco made major inroads to African funk in the late 70s, and this song is a good example of that influence making itself felt.\n205. Ogyatanaa Show Band: \"Disco Africa\" [Ghana, 1976]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz 2: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nOgyatanaa (Burning Torch) was the outlet for the compositions of Kwadwo Donkoh, one of Ghana's greatest producers and musical innovators-- his fingerprints are on dozens of the best Ghanaian Afrobeat and funk records and he's responsible for both the first instrumental LP released in West Africa (Keyboard Africa by Ray Ellis), as well as the only known album of African Christmas songs. \"Disco Africa\" rides a killer break and keeps the vocals low in the mix, just letting the groove do its thing. Incredibly, Soundway is the first label ever to issue it.\n206. Wallias Band: \"Muziqawi Silt\" [Ethiopia, 1977]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 13: Ethiopian Groove [Buda Musique] and The Rough Guide to the Music of Ethiopia [Rough Guides]\nIf James Bond were named Alemayehu and worked for the Negus instead of the Queen, this could be his theme song. Wallias Band was led by Girma Beyene and was one of a few outfits that managed to have creative success in the Mengistu years, lasting all the way through the extremely tumultuous 80s. This is a killer Ethio-groove instrumental with a perfect, unique mix of sleek soul and deep, dark horns only Addis Ababa seems capable of turning out. The nagging guitar and bobbing rhythm section exude icy cool, and the lo-fi recording (two microphones, max) shrouds it in a mysterious, majestic veil that no slick recording could ever capture.\n207. Lemma Demissew: \"Astawesalehu\" [Ethiopia, 1968 or 69]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\nLemma Demissew was a pianist for several of the Ethiopian institutional bands, and on his own he has a bizarre resemblance to Fats Domino. \"Astawesalehu\" is an Ethiopian \"Ain't That a Shame\", with Demissew's motoring piano powering a piece of sweet, old-timey rock'n'roll that was likely created with only the barest of knowledge of what that actually sounded like. The call-and-response vocals are infectious and unusually sunny for Ethiopian music, and if American radio conglomerates were willing to overlook the fact that it's sung in Amharic, this could slot in pretty well on any oldies station's playlist.\n208. Apagya Show Band: \"Kwaku Ananse\" [Ghana, 1974]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\"Kwaku Ananse\" has all the hallmarks of great Ghanaian Afrobeat: Big, crashing cadences, hovering electric organs mixing with tight horns, and an urgent, propulsive beat designed to hold and release tension as needed. The rhythm comprises dozens of small components, like the ultra-simple, repetitive bassline, a ton of percussionists mingling in polyrhythmic conversation, and the song swaggers swiftly along for an economical three minutes, incredibly brief by Afrobeat standards. Apagya was something of a Ghanaian supergroup, featuring Ebo Taylor, Bob Pinado, Gyedu Blay-Ambolley, and members of the Uhuru Dance Band.\n209. Fela Ransome Kuti & Africa '70: \"Roforofo Fight\" [Nigeria, 1972]\nAvailable on Roforofo Fight/The Fela Singles [MCA/Universal], The Best Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal], Music Is the Weapon: The Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal], Two Sides of Fela: Jazz & Dance [Barclay], Music Is the Weapon of the Future, Vol. 1 [Exworks], Essential Afrobeat: The Very Best of Afrobeat 3CD Mix [Family Recordings], AfricaFunk, Vol. 2: Return to the Original Sound of 1970s Funky Africa [Harmless], and Best of the Black President [Knitting Factory]\n\"Roforofo Fight\" is one of Fela's early masterworks, riding one of his trademark infinite grooves, with claves and shakers guiding Tony Allen's across-the-beat drumwork. Muted guitars insist on forward motion and even the horns settle into riffs, with an especially catchy sax ostinato backing up the melodic solos at the end.\nFela's vocals are twitchy and frenetic, spilling out in scat passages and ignoring the boundaries between English and Yoruba. The narrative basically speaks of how two men fighting makes a fool of both men, and Fela uncharacteristically takes the mic at the beginning of the song, presaging the powerful horn themes with a strange bilingual monologue about trousers and pants that he would later build into a full-bodied metaphor for colonial oppression on Opposite People's \"Equalisation of Trouser and Pant\".\n210. Monomono: \"Tire Loma Da Nigbehin\" [Nigeria, 1974]\nAvailable on Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\nMonomono was led by the great Joni Haastrup, and they played deep funk full of harmony vocals, bubbling organ, and sharply strummed guitars. \"Tire Loma Da Nigbehin\" rides that deep funk base, coloring the edges with psychedelic flourishes in a prime example of the melting pot that West African popular music was in the 70s.\n211. Ofo the Black Company: \"Allah Wakbarr\" [Nigeria, 1972]\nAvailable on World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing, the Funky Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa [Luaka Bop] and Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\nOfo's biggest hit may feature lyrics exalting God, but the holy racket they churn out here is more commonly associated with the man downstairs. This is ridiculously heavy, riding a distorted guitar figure and pounding drums and the lead guitars and organ wail away. It's crushing, funky acid rock and truly amazing stuff.\n212. Joe Mensah: \"Africa Is Home\" [Ghana, 1975]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz 2: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nJoe Mensah's jazz influence is clear on \"Africa Is Home\", and both the drums and congas play fast and loose with the rhythms. The horns are right out in your face, though, and the female backing vocals' intonation of \"home sweet home\" has a nearly doo wop feel to it. That epic horn arrangement is what really makes this cook, though.\n213. Lijadu Sisters: \"Orere Eljigbo\" [Nigeria, 1979]\nAvailable on Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut] and Essential Afrobeat: the Very Best of Afrobeat 3CD Mix [Family Recordings]\n\"Get Out/ Fight/ Trouble in the streets\" is the rallying cry the Lijadu Sisters use to open this disco-influenced song. The sisters had toured with Ginger Baker's Salt and can be heard on a great many Nigerian recordings of the 70s and 80s. This song, whose story of a couple attempting to have a child without success is typical of many African popular songs in its use of everyday drama to point out inadequacies in society at large, amply demonstrates that they were capable of striking gold on their own.\n214. Bembeya Jazz National: \"Petit Sekou\" [Guinea, 1977]\nAvailable on The Syliphone Years [Sterns Africa]\nBembeya cut a huge number of stunning records, but this may be the best. An instrumental featuring Sekou Diabate's guitar front and center, it slinks through bluesy verses and cuts on a dime into unexpected swing passages. In the blues sections, Diabate's guitar burns with the tone of Robert Fripp and the intensity of Eddie Hazel, even more remarkable given that it's unlikely Diabate knew who either man was. This is a jaw-dropping piece of music, and it's a wonder it hasn't shown up in more places.\n301. Gyedu Blay-Ambolley & the Steneboofs: \"Simigwado\" [Ghana, 1973]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nUnfortunately, I can't figure out how to transcribe all of the funky little vocalizations Gyedu Blay makes on \"Simigwado\", nor his Fanti rapping, so it's difficult to convey just how infectious this song is. The song was banned for being obscene by Ghanaian authorities, though they had no idea what it was actually about. Turns out anyone who speaks English will learn pretty quickly that it's a dance, because Gyedu spells it out pretty clearly: \"One, two, three, baby/ Oh-ah-oh can you dance?/ We call it Simigwa/ I'm gonna show you how to do it, yeah\" before the colossal horn arrangement kicks in.\n302. Jingo: \"Fever\" [country unknown, 1974]\nAvailable on Afro-Rock, Volume 1 [Evolver]\n\"Fever\" puts its polyrhythm right out front, layering a 6/8 chakachas beat over a thumping 4/4 funk groove. The vocal melody, bassline, and horn arrangement are all syncopated differently, giving the song undeniable forward momentum. Between the verses, a grunting, screaming Jingo duels it out with the free-flowing solos of one his sax players, and the listener comes out on top.\n303. Joni Haastrup: \"Greetings\" [Nigeria, 1977]\nAvailable on Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\nJoni Hasstrup (I've also seen it spelled Johnny) was a well-traveled individual, leading several Nigerian rock and funk bands during the 60s and 70s and joining Ginger Baker's sadly short-lived Salt project, a half British/half African band that attempted to wed UK rock to Afrobeat, which wasn't actually as big a stretch as it might sound. On his own, he was a sharp songwriter, and \"Greetings\" is an absolute dancefloor killer with a monster bassline. Haastrup's soulful vocals tower over the recording, dripping with reverb in an otherwise dry mix. It's sung in Yoruba, but this still could have lit up an American disco in '78.\n304. Honny & the Bees Band: \"Psychedelic Woman\" [Ghana, 1973]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\"Psychedelic\" was a world-wide buzzword in its day, and on one of his few solo tracks, Ghanaian session keyboardist Ernest Honny runs down the exploits of the psychedelic men and women of Accra in all of the hottest nightpots, including the Apollo and Star Hotel. His organ solo is spectacular, but the song is probably most notable for slipping from a slow Afrobeat verse into a massive mod chorus, with big harmonies that could have fit nicely on a Yardbirds record. It's a stunning collision of Western and African music in which both get their big moments, and it's even more incredible when you consider that the song is a full quarter of all his recorded output.\n305. Yahoos: \"Mabala\" [country and year unknown]\nAvailable on Afro-Rock, Volume 1 [Evolver]\nThis is one of only a couple vintage African dub tracks I've heard, which is kind of surprising given that Jamaican music otherwise had a broad influence on West Africa. Strange swirling noises and a disembodied woman's voice hover over the band's solid base of breezy funk, but we're not quite in Lee Perry territory-- aside from the effects and samples, the recording is straightforward midtempo funk with impressive sax and guitar solos, with a minimum of stereo trickery and other deep dub trademarks.\n306. Blo: \"Blo\" [Nigeria, 1975]\nAvailable on Phases: 1972-1982 [AfroStrut] and Afro-Funk Explosion: Motherload From the Motherland [Explosive Entertainment]\nBlo's Phases retrospective is sadly out of print now (R.I.P. Strut), but hopefully somebody will resurrect it soon. The Nigerian band played a distinctly hard brand of psychedelic funk, and their signature song is drenched in organ and wah pedal. The arrangement is full of clever details and unexpected start/stop passages, and guitarist Berkley \"Ike\" Jones' solo positively rips.\n__307. Tlahoun Gessesse: \"Alegntaye\" [Ethiopia, 1973]\n__Available on Éthiopiques 17: Tlahoun Gessesse [Buda Musique] and The Rough Guide to the Music of Ethiopia [Rough Guides]\nTlahoun Gessesse was one of Ethiopia's biggest stars, having performed with all the big institutional bands in the 50s and 60s, and he had one of the country's most prolific recording careers in the years leading up to the overthrow of Haile Selassie and the death of Ethiopia's most vitally creative period. \"Alegntaye\" means \"My Hope\", though Western ears would have a tough time reading a tender song of yearning into Gessesse's mind-blowing melismatic vocals and Mulatu Astatque's inky arrangement. Astatque's midnight funky aesthetic is deeply alluring, though, and the sputtering, wah'd-out guitar works nicely as a searching sonic analogue to Gessesse's pleas: \"Where can I find you?/ I am all mixed up/ Where are you hiding, my love?/ Show yourself, I miss you.\"\n__308. K. Frimpong & His Cubano Fiestas: \"Hwehwe Mu Na Yi Wo Mpena\" [Ghana, 1977]\n__Available on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nCuban music had more of an impact on Africa's far western coast than it did along the southern coast of West Africa, but it shows up now and then. K. Frimpong was one of Ghana's most innovative guitar players, slyly funky and a skilled, fluid soloist. His \"Cubano Fiestas\", as they're credited here, were actually Vis-a-Vis, a prolific and quite capable band in their own right. The song's Cuban feel comes mostly in the vocals and chord progression, while the bounding, anti-gravity rhythms are all Ghanaian Afrobeat.\n__309. Fela Anikulapo Kuti & Africa '70: \"Gentleman\" [Nigeria, 1973]\n__Available on Confusion/Gentleman [MCA/Universal], The Best Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal] [edit], Music Is the Weapon: The Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal] [edit], Music Is the Weapon of the Future, Vol. 2 [Exworks], and Best of the Black President [Knitting Factory]\nFela was sent by his parents to Britain to study medicine, but he was more interested in playing jazz and highlife and we're all better off for it. His jazz influence comes through very strongly on \"Gentleman\", the title track from one of his 1973 albums, where he solos on his tenor over most of the song's nine-minute intro, including a beautiful solo passage where the rhythm section lays out entirely. He switches to his ever-present Rhodes piano during the vocal sections, and the instrument's mellow tone in its lowest register has a strangely cooling effect on the hot midtempo groove the band generates.\nFela's lyric is one of his many anti-colonial ruminations decrying Africans' adoption of Western cultural norms. \"I no be gentleman at all,\" he sings, ridiculing Europeans' concept of social class, \"I be Africa man original.\" To drive home the point, the album cover features an ape in a three-piece suit.\n310. Manu Dibango: \"African Battle\" [Cameroon, 1973 or 74]\nAvailable on AfricaFunk: The Original Sound of 1970s Funky Africa [Harmless], Uncle Junior's Friday Fish Fry, mix by DJ Djinji Brown [Uncle Junior] and Afro-Funk Explosion: Motherload From the Motherland [Explosive Entertainment]\nYou can't get much more upbeat than this tune from Cameroon's greatest star. An instrumental featuring a massive horn arrangement and a cliff-diving bassline, \"African Battle\" features trumpets blaring at the top of their range and Dibango's own flashy sax work as well as an army of conga players. It's over in less than three minutes, but what a ride.\n__311. Alemayehu Eshete: \"Addis Ababa Bete\" [Ethiopia, 1992]\n__Available on Addis Ababa [Shanachie] and The Rough Guide to the Music of Ethiopia [Rough Guides]\nEthiopia's Swinging Addis scene came to a sad close in the 70s, but many of its exponents continued on. Alemayehu Eshete was one of Ethiopia's biggest stars and best performers during the golden years of Ethiopian music, but this track from his 1992 album Addis Ababa is crazier than anything he did in his heyday. The song rides a positively evil piano part, with drums functioning merely as a rhythmic guide. The horn section plays a repetitive, tense figure that nags at Eshete's twisting, wildly melismatic vocal part, splitting up at the end into crazed, simultaneous solos. A lot of French prog tried really hard in the 70s to be this frightening, but this beats it all.\n__312. Shina Williams & His African Percussionists: \"Agboju Logun\" [12-inch mix] [Nigeria, 1984]\n__Available on Nigeria 70: The Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\nDoes ZE Records know about this Shina Williams track? Because not only would it fit pretty nicely on any of their Mutant Disco compilations, it would also be the best track. This is actually the 12-inch mix of a 1984 song, and it features former members of Monomono, Africa '70, and Orlando Julius' Afro-Sounders, making it something of a Nigerian super-session. Williams himself was better known as Juju star King Sunny Adé's manager, but the groove here is an irresistible post-disco lockgroove stuffed with muted guitars and breathy female vocals. Talking drums exhale along with sleek horn sections, adding extra funk to what amounts to a killer African New Wave track.\n401. Bob Pinado & His Sound Casters: \"Me, You, One [Means I Love You]\" [Ghana, 1976]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz 2: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\"Me, you, one, baby, means I love you,\" sings Pinado, and it doesn't get much more straightforward than that. The song has a chilled, subtly funky groove that blows up when he gets to the huge refrain. Pinado had a powerful, distinctive voice, and he uses every bit of that power on this track.\n__402. Koola Lobitos: \"Highlife Time\" [Nigeria, 1965]\n__Available on Koola Lobitos/The '69 LA Sessions [Knitting Factory]\nBeing familiar with his later material, it's almost amusing to hear Fela singing, \"I jump for joy in the swinging club,\" but, then why wouldn't he jump for joy? It is highlife time after all. Fela hadn't yet been introduced to black radicalism, nor been disillusioned by the Biafran War, a brutal conflict that nearly tore his country to shreds, and it's fascinating to hear how exuberant he was on this formative material, when the post-colonial promise still hung in the air and highlife still ruled in West Africa.\n__403. 3rd Generation Band: \"Because of Money\" [Ghana, 1973]\n__Available on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nThe 3rd Generation Band's \"Because of Money\" is extremely blunt in its criticism of monetary greed-- a few minutes in, the singer announces \"I am gonna' speak English now/ For the benefit of everybody.\" And then he launches into a diatribe about money's corrupting influence. This is a killer Afrobeat track laid over a bed of hypnotic percussion, but this band was actually a highlife group affiliated with the Ghanaian army! Even if they were [ironically] just cashing in on Fela's massive popularity, they did a damn good job of it.\n__404. Mercury Dance Band: \"Envy No Good\" [country, year unknown]\n__Available on Afro-Rock, Vol. 1 [Evolver]\nMuch like the track that precedes it on this disc, \"Envy No Good\" is a highlife orchestras stab at Afrobeat, undertaken after the band took in a concert by Fela and the Africa '70. \"Envy No Good\" is naturally a pidgin English bit of stern moralizing, very common in the genre, but this song is all about the thick, crashing horn arrangement, a positively gargantuan orchestration that saturates the tape when it comes in.\n__405. Mahmoud Ahmed: \"Mar Teb Yelal Kafesh\" [Ethiopia, 1975]\n__Available on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\n\"Mar Teb Yelal Kafesh\" is Ethiopian funk-pop at its best-- skillfully composed, catchy as hell, and brilliantly arranged. The horns emphasize the offbeats in the A section, offer a countermelody in the B, and crash the gates in the rumbling transitions between sections. The arrangement makes skillful use of rhythmic variation and modulation to make each verse feel more exultant than the last, and Ahmed's voice is more than up to the task, ornamenting the honey-sweet melody with that characteristic Ethiopian melisma.\n406. E.T. Mensah & His Tempos Band: \"205\" [Ghana, late 1950s]\nAvailable on Day By Day [Retro Afric]\nE.T. Mensah was the king of highlife, and songs like \"205\" make it clear why. He's singing in Twi, one of about a dozen languages in which he recorded, but it sounds utterly effortless, and the horn arrangement is a bouncy, fruity thing that bounds along on a peppy Caribbean/jazz beat complete with a swinging bassline.\n__407. Bembeya Jazz National: \"N'Gamokoro\" [Guinea, 1973]\n__Available on The Syliphone Years [Sterns Africa]\nBembeya get funky, and the result is a 10-minute odyssey through a sort of alternative reality Afrobeat world, with plenty of solo trading and a mind-bending guitar part from Sekou Diabate, a part that cycles over and over like a spinning wheel, leaping off into flights of melodic fancy with seemingly no effort.\n408. Tamrat Ferendji & Sensation Band: \"Antchin Yagegnulet\" [Ethiopia, 1977]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 13: Ethiopian Groove [Buda Musique]\nThis is one of a handful of Kaifa Records recordings to see release in Ethiopia's early derg period, an era of horrible repression by Mengistu's communist government. The song rides a pounding, four-on-the-floor beat topped with fluttering organ and a swaying horn section, culminating in a rare, excellent flute solo. Ferendji's vocal style doesn't go as frequently to the billowing melisma of many of his colleagues, something that may make it easier for a lot of Westerners to dig his stuff straight off.\n__409. Matata: \"Wanna Do My Thing\" [Kenya, early 70s]\n__Available on Afro-Funk Explosion: Motherload From the Motherland [Explosive Entertainment]\nAnother burning chunk of nasty funk from the Kenyan masters, this one catchier and poppier than \"Talkin' Talkin'\". It's still got a hard horn arrangement, dirty groove, and completely unhinged lead vocal, though, and you've got to think James Brown would have been proud to call this one his own.\n410. Lekan Animashaun: \"Serere\" [Nigeria, recorded 1979, overdubs 1986, released 1995]\nAvailable on the split release Lekan Animashaun: Low Profile/Mr. Big Mouth: Tunde Williams Plays with Africa '70 [Honest Jon's]\nBaritone saxophonist Lekan Animashaun was Fela's most loyal sideman, providing the crunching low-end for every one of Fela's bands, from Koola Lobitos to Egypt 80, which is now fronted by Fela's son Seun. His only album under his own name has a convoluted history: Composed in the mid-70s, it was partially recorded during the turbulent days at the end of the decade, after the Africa '70 had dissolved and Fela had set about gathering the musicians for Egypt 80.\nRecording was finished in 1986, but Fela served an extended prison term on trumped-up currency charges in the mid-80s, and Low Profile was finally released in 1995, though it promptly went out of print. Thankfully, Honest Jon's has brought it back, and \"Serere\" is the truly stunning track from side two. The horn arrangement is bold and dramatic, featuring call and response phrases that Fela then imitates on his Rhodes piano. \"If you want to get justice/ You must practice justice,\" he sings, and it's clear that Fela's musicians shared more than just musical direction with him.\n411. Dick Khoza: \"Chapita\" [South Africa, 1976]\nAvailable on Afrika Underground: Jazz, Funk & Fusion Under Apartheid [Counterpoint] and Afro-Funk Explosion: Motherload From the Motherland [Explosive Entertainment]\n\"Chapita\" features a pretty nasty beat for a South African funk track, and the contrast with the smooth sax lick is welcome. Khoza's vocal is a weird, baritone drawl, and he talks more than he sings, backed by a long, drawn-out recitation of the title by his backing singers. The instrumental bridges are nice crawling funk workouts, but it's the unexpected harmony vocals that deliver a totally new verse nearly five minutes in that complete the song.\n412. Tesfa Maryam Kidane: \"Yetesfa Tezeta\" [Ethiopia, 1969]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\nThis instrumental is sort of an Ethiopian spin on the blues-based instrumentals of early rock'n'roll. Frequently, those early instrumentals are just the band playing the blues progression and maybe soloing a bit over it. If you think about it, that's all \"Wipe Out\" is. This adds a bit of funk to that equation, but otherwise, it's a big band playing round with a blues progression and evidently having a lot of fun doing it. Kidane was a well-traveled session saxophonist in Ethiopia, but he actually takes a shorter solo than the guitarist, perhaps not wanting to show off too much.\n413. Mulatu Astatque: \"Kasalefkut Hulu\" [Ethiopia, 1972]\nAvailable of Éthiopiques 4: Ethio Jazz & Instrumentals [Buda Musique]\nMulatu Astatque's instrumental music has a sound all its own-- dark but undeniably funky. This one rides a buoyant, repetitive bass line, layering tightly scored horns on top of it, and the effect is like Duke Ellington dropping in on an Addis Ababa nightclub with an armful of charts.\n__414. Kokolo: \"Mister Sinister\" [United States, 2004]\n__Available on More Consideration [Ray Lugo], ASAP: Afrobeat Sudan Aid Project [Mobida Productions]\nThe lead vocals don't really convince me, but they're passable, and the backing vocals are spot-on, along with everything else about this track. The New York-based Afrobeat revival is full of musicians who obviously have listened to every detail of every Fela record they could get their hands on, and \"Mister Sinister\" rides a galloping beat with an elastic horn arrangement, grounded by a truly righteous baritone sax part.\n415. Tlahoun Gessesse: \"Aykedashem Lebe\" [Ethiopia, 1974]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 17: Tlahoun Gessesse [Buda Musique]\nGessesse really cuts loose on this song, an uptempo Ethio-funk banger that answers his falsetto howls with stabbing horns and tweaked-out organ interjections. The drum break is low in the mix, as usual with Ethiopian recordings, but it's a hell of a beat, and together with the scratchy rhythm guitar, it's a concrete-solid groove.\n501. Manu Dibango: \"Soul Makossa\" [Cameroon, 1972]\nAvailable on dozens of releases, including Dibango: Soul Makossa [Unidisc], Africadelic: The Best of Manu Dibango [Mercury], Anthology [Eagle], Very Best of Manu Dibango: AfroSoulJazz [Manteca] and various artists compilations such as Essential Afrobeat: The Very Best of Afrobeat 3CD Mix [Family Recordings], Get Down Tonight: The Disco Explosion [Shout! Factory], The Beginner's Guide to World Music, Vol. 2 [Nascente] and Crooklyn, Vol. 2 [MCA]\nWith its nasty, fractured sax line, thumping beat, and tight rhythm, \"Soul Makossa\" was a decent-sized hit in the U.S.-- a rarity for an African artist-- and still gets a spin now and then in the clubs of New York. Afrika Bambaataa covered it and sampled it on his last record, and it's truly a classic slice of funk. Mostly instrumental, it nevertheless features the infectious \"mama-ko mama-sa mako-makossa\" chant, and it still sounds fantastic all these years later.\n502. Ebo Taylor: \"Heaven\" [Ghana, 1977]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\n\"Heaven\" is the most weightless funk track I know, sounding almost as though it's floating up to its titular destination. The emphasis is all on the upbeats, with congas and cowbell bobbing in a current of electric organ. Taylor's guitar is placed low in the mix, with opposing parts playing in the left and right channels, one a squelchy, wah'd-out funk part, the other a clean-toned, highlife-ish part. In fact, Taylor's four albums are all split between popular highlife fare on side one and his totally unique brand of Afrobeat on side two. This track features a percussive horn attack and some great call-and-response vocals-- they're so tight that the backing vocals almost sound like chorused delay at times.\n503. Hugh Masekela & the Union of South Africa: \"Dyambo\" [South Africa, 1971]\nAvailable on Club Africa 2 [Strut] and Hugh Masekela & the Union of South Africa [reissued Motown]\nI'm a little unclear on when exactly this song was first released, but it had to be the 70s, because funk hasn't sounded this good in any other decade. The South African ex-pat's fluent trumpet playing is a highlight, and the band offers a propulsive funk backing for Masekela's always-melodic flights. The vocals are taken in a loose group-- not so much harmony as a big sing-a-long, and by the end of the jam that swallows the middle of the song, they're subsumed into the mix in such a way that they become another part of the texture.\n504. Sweet Talks: \"Kye Kye Pe Aware\" [Ghana, 1976]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz 2: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nThe Sweet Talks' Kusum Beat album deserves a reissue to itself, because the two tracks I've heard are jaw-dropping. The band's rhythmic attack in the 70s was sick-- their drummer was a breakbeat maniac, and they augmented it with a ton of traditional percussion, slathering huge, sinewy electric organ on top. A.B. Crentsil's vocals slide coolly into the rhythmic sluice of the music, and the band loved to just lay back and vamp on these killer grooves they created.\n505. Rob: \"Make it Fast, Make it Slow\" [Ghana, 1977]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nRob is apparently a pastor now, and I have to wonder what he thinks about his obscene vocal performance on this humid, trunk-rattling slow jam. His heavy breathing, punctuated by thrusting horns, leaves no ambiguity as to the meaning of \"Make it Fast, Make it Slow\". Its rhythm is so measured and languid that the bass, snare, and organ virtually take turns at emphasizing different beats. Something makes me bet that this is the only 70s Ghanaian sex jam you're ever likely to hear, but that's what the repeat button is for.\n__506. William Onyeabor: \"Better Change Your Mind\" [Nigeria, 1978]\n__Available on World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing, the Funky Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa [Luaka Bop] and Nigeria 70: the Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\nThe title of this song isn't about reversing a decision-- as Onyeabor makes clear through his lyrics, which admonish various world powers about their arrogance-- it's about changing the way we think about the world. The chunky beat marinates in a heavy sauce of trebly synthesizer, and the guitar has a truly odd, chorused tone that makes me wonder if it's actually two guitars playing roughly in sync with each other.\n507. Bahta Gebre Heywet: \"Tessassategn Eko\" [Ethiopia, 1973]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\nThis is an exceptionally breezy Ethiopian pop song, with a doggedly consonant horn arrangement and a laid-back vocal by Heywet. Most Ethiopian songs can't be casually hummed, but this one flows easily from the back of the throat at odd times of the day. The solo trumpet melody blows in on the quickly shuffling beat like a lazy summer day, a reminder that funk doesn't have to be all nasty.\n508. Ayalew Mesfin & Black Lion Band: \"Gud Aderegetchegn\" [Ethiopia, 1977]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 13: Ethiopian Groove [Buda Musique]\nBlack Lion Band were a powerhouse rhythm band, and this song rampages on a swaying guitar riff and driving bass drums while Mesfin's vocal melody plays directly against the groove. The song has a totally unstoppable chorus, with Mesfin singing the title over and over, syncopating it differently each time. For a scene that was being strangled to death in 1977, Addis managed quite a few interesting recordings, and this is one of the best.\n509. Sahara All Stars Band Jos: \"Enjoy Yourself\" [Nigeria, year unknown]\nAvailable on Nigeria 70: the Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\nSahara All Stars, based in the northern Nigerian City of Jos, essentially ran Nigeria's Hausa funk scene and were its greatest exponent. The beat is spare and spacious, with a lacerating guitar part and a steady drum-and-conga break joined by an almost incongruously soft Rhodes piano. The lyrics are in pidgin English, and feature heavy use of the word \"quench,\" which in the dialect is directly akin to \"die.\"\nPidgin English is a fascinating evolution of language, and it's interesting to hear how the grammatical structure of sentences differs from what we're used to, not to mention the use of separate, unconjugated \"go\" verbs placed before other verbs. Anyway, \"Enjoy Yourself\" warns listeners to get as much out of life as possible before the inevitable strikes, and then helps them do it.\n510. Christy Azuma & Uppers International: \"Naam\" [Ghana, 1976]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz 2: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nFemale stars are very rare in Afrobeat, and it would actually be kind of hard to call Christy Azuma a star-- her records weren't even released in her own home country of Ghana, as the Ghanaian Hausa community they were aimed at was generally too poor to own record players. She sings in a traditional head voice as the Uppers thrash along behind her with a tight, percolating funk rhythm, and if the rest of Ghana didn't want to listen, well, it was their loss.\n__511. Mahmoud Ahmed: \"Kulun Mankwalesh\" [Ethiopia, 1973]\n__Available on Almaz [Ahma] and Éthiopiques 6: Almaz [Buda Musique]\n\"Kulun Mankwalesh\" is actually a traditional wedding song that received numerous intriguing interpretations by various constituents of Swinging Addis. This one is from Almaz, Mahmoud Ahmed's first of an unequaled (in Ethiopia) four albums. The record has an interesting suite-like structure where the songs flow easily into one another, and all are brimming with wah-drenched guitar and psychedelic flourishes of flute and organ. Ahmed's second album, 1975's Ere Mela Mela, became the first Ethiopian record distributed outside of the country when it was finally issued in Europe in 1986, bringing the first glimpse of Swinging Addis to an unsuspecting world.\n512. Alemayehu Eshete: \"Eskegizew Bertchi\" [Ethiopia, 1974]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\n\"Eskegizew Bertchi\" is a funky, horn-fueled rock tune that Eshete has his way with, splattering his wild vocals all over it. It's a shame Ethiopia has become a Sally Struthers grotesque in the minds of so many Westerners, as it's a deeply complex nation and hardly the repository for starvation that most people associate it so closely with. Part of the joy of getting into the music and exploring the varied work of a guy like Eshete-- who was also a session bassist and a decent guitarist-- is getting inside the mind of someone from a country whose population you're not expected to identify with. You think Ethiopia's just a miserable den of anonymous poverty where photographers go to win their Pulitzers? Well, here's a song about a guy in love. Suddenly we're closer than we seemed.\n513. Salif Keita: \"Mandjou\" [Mali, 1978]\nAvailable on Salif Keita: the Best of the Early Years [Wrasse], 1969-1980 [Sonodisc], Best of Salif Keita, the Golden Voice [Wrasse]\nKeita is often referred to as the Golden Voice of Mali, and he does have a pretty impressive set of pipes. He's descended from royal lineage but was born albino, considered a sign of bad luck in Mali, and found himself left outside of the trappings of privileged life. He gravitated to music and wound up as a regular in Super Rail Band de Bamako, Mali's greatest band in the early 70s. He cut \"Mandjou\" with his second band, Les Ambassadeurs Internationale, in 1978, and it's an acknowledged classic of African music, riding a subtly funky groove and some beautiful lead guitar work. The horn arrangement is deeply Cuban, which puts it in a strange light next to Keita's instantly recognizable tenor, a voice that sounds as steadfastly Saharan as possible. Frankly, I haven't liked a thing Keita has done since Les Ambassadeurs-- it's got that drum machine/Kawai preset Afro-pop sound that I can't stand-- but his work in the 70s is powerful stuff, all the better for its raggedness.\n514. Assagai: \"Cocoa\" [South Africa, 1971]\nAvailable on Afro-Funk Explosion: Motherload From the Motherland [Explosive Entertainment] and Assagai [Vertigo]\nAssagai are named for a spear generally associated with the Zulu militaries of the early colonial era, but their sound is a bit more relaxed than the name would have you believe. The horn arrangements are slow and slurred, the vocals just as slow and perhaps as slurred-- I can't tell because I don't know what language they're in. They called their music Afro-rock and even released an album under that title, but to my ears, this is slow-motion funk with an unusual piano underpinning, and it's a good comedown from some of their more frenetic colleagues.\n601. Lourdes Van Dunem: \"Ngongo ya Biluka\" [Angola, 1972]\nAvailable on Angola 70s: 1972-1973 [Buda Musique]\nWomen in the Western music industry certainly have it tougher than men, but at least we accept the very thought of an independent female performer. It wasn't like that when Lourdes Van Dunem began her singing career in Angola, then still under Portuguese rule (as it would be until 1975). And it didn't get any easier-- she was imprisoned for a time by the colonial government, and if the music industries in countries like Benin and Cote d'Ivoire were underprivileged, then Angola's was outright deprived. Still, there are lots of interesting recordings of the country's signature semba music (a quick-paced variant on Brazil's samba) and this is a personal favorite. The rhythms are tight, the melody is infectious, and there's even some mildly inventive lead guitar around the edges, the only sound covered in reverb on an otherwise utterly dry recording.\n602. Guerilla: \"La Popo\" [country, year unknown]\nAvailable on The Danque!! [Afrodisiac]\nThis intro is just to die for-- two minutes of careening rhythms and frenzied but melodic organ that exude cool. The rest of the song is almost a different beast entirely, carrying over only the intro's disco hi-hat. The vocals are so rough they occasionally sound like a roar, and the guitar solos are interested in melody only insofar as it can lead to a freak-out. It's too bad the intro never reprises, but this is still a sweet piece of rock-tinged funk.\n603. Peter King: \"Mystery Tour\" [Nigeria, 1976]\nAvailable on Shango [AfroStrut]\nPeter King was a highly educated musician, and today he runs a music school in his native Nigeria. He has songs that I almost think were held back by his extensive schooling, which may have caused him to smooth the compositional edges too much. \"Mystery Tour\" is not one of those songs. His sax playing darts and dives like it came off a bop record, and the rhythm is pure, gutbucket funk that's miles into the jungle groove. The Shango in the album title was the Yoruban god of thunder and the mythical ancestor of all Yorubans, and it's not difficult to hear that King was trying to bring a little of his own thunder on the record, one of his rawest.\n604. Samuel Belay: \"Aynotchesh Yerefu\" [Ethiopia, 1973]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique]\nThis song is a good example of the perils of translating Ethiopian phonemes into words Westerners can theoretically pronounce. From what I can gather, the Ethiopian alphabet is much like Hebrew or Arabic, in that vowels don't get their space, acting instead as modifiers on consonants. Amharic and Oromo-- the country's two main languages-- are also fairly guttural, and as a result the phonetic interpretations we use are destined to be imperfect. When Belay belts out the title of this filthy funk tune, it at first sound like at least four words, and then you realize that \"Yerefu\" is being pronounced \"Ee-yair-eh-foo\" and it makes sense. I've reached the point now where I can sing along to certain songs in Amharic, and it's a blast-- even if I have no idea what I'm saying.\n605. Ebo Taylor: \"Atwer Abroba\" [Ghana, 1977]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz 2: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nThis is more stratospheric funk from our man Ebo-- this time with a far more dramatic and pronounced horn arrangement. The thing kicks in with a quick hit on about 14 instruments at once, and the horn theme rides roughshod over Taylor's trademark beat, building to big, crashing cadences and then heading back to zero gravity. Taylor seems like a guy whose full albums would be worth a long look if a sufficient source for remastering can be located.\n606. Tony Allen & His Afro Messengers: \"No Discrimination\" [Nigeria, 1979]\nAvailable on No Accommodation For Lagos/No Discrimination [Evolver], Nigeria 70: the Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut] and Eager Hands & Restless Feet: The Best of Tony Allen [Wrasse]\nTony Allen is nearly as important a figure in Afrobeat as Fela; his drumming style was the engine of Africa '70, pushing Fela's arrangements and providing the pulse for his protests. Allen's solo material is mostly not on the same level as his work with Fela, basically on account of the fact that he wasn't as accomplished at songwriting. Still, he produced some thrilling stuff on his own, crowned by \"No Discrimination\", a song that's owned by his innovative beatmaking. The muted rhythm guitars and big choral call-and-response of Africa '70 are here, but the whole thing is looser, allowing Allen's drum kit to ground everything.\nCandido Obajimi's vocal ranges from jazzy scatting to declarations of \"Civilization\" (answered by a chorus of \"now him we want\") and \"Discrimination\" (answered with \"now him we don't want\"). Allen has continued his progressive path over the years, branching out into hip-hop and electronic music, and he seems like a natural for both-- after all, his distinctive drums breaks could provide all the beatmaking material a hip-hop DJ would need, and his endless rhythm concept applies quite readily to electronic dance music.\n__607. Johnson Mkhalali: \"Joyce No. 2\" [South Africa, 1985]\n__Available on The Indestructible Beat of Soweto [Earthworks]\nRobert Christgau called The Indestructible Beat of Soweto the most important record of the 80s, and while I don't agree, I can see his point. It's the first document of the mbaqanga music of South Africa's sprawling black townships to make it out of the country in large numbers. This bouncy number is a guitar-led instrumental stuffed with wheezing accordion and borne on a four-on-the-floor stomp that showcases everything charming about the style-- the ebullience, the fluidity, the indomitable spirit, the indestructible beat.\n608. King Sunny Adé & His African Beats: \"Ja Funmi\" [Nigeria, 1982]\nAvailable on Juju Music [Island Mango], Nigeria 70: the Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut] [instrumental version], King of Juju: The Best of Sunny Adé [Wrasse], African Heartbeat: The Essential African Music Collection [Shanachie]\nSunny Adé is a huge star in Africa and his native Nigeria in particular, and he's the acknowledged master and modernizer of the country's traditional Juju music, a mantel he inherited from the late I.K. Dairo. This song is the lead track on Juju Music, his first record to feature synthesizers and a Western producer. Truthfully, his music was better off without those things, but this track is largely missing them anyway. It does have a very cool slide guitar solo in the middle of it and a hypnotic groove composed of several interlocking guitar parts, piano, and lots of hand percussion. It's not much of a leap between here and Remain in Light.\n__609. Amaswazi Emvelo: \"Indoda Yejazi Elimnyama\" [South Africa, 1985]\n__Available on The Indestructible Beat of Soweto [Earthworks]\nA vocal track from the same Soweto comp, this has the big backing harmonies that characterized mbaqanga vocal tracks but adds a bizarre twist: The song is about a guy who is harassed for his money every day while walking home (not an uncommon dilemma in the townships), and his harasser is voiced by someone speaking through some sort of vocal processor, lending it a freaky, almost sci-fi edge that sets it apart from all the other township music I've heard.\n610. Pacific Express: \"The Way it Used to Be\" [South Africa, 1978]\nAvailable on Afrika Underground: Jazz, Funk & Fusion Under Apartheid [Counterpoint]\nA nice, rough drum part full of China crash cymbal provides the undercarriage for this unusually gritty bit of South African fusion. The synthesizers and Rhodes piano flail about on top of the beat for most of the song, and that's basically it-- wild self-indulgence redeemed by a killer beat.\n611. Miriam Makeba: \"Maria Fulo\" [South Africa, 1967]\nAvailable on In Concert/Pata Pata/Makeba! [Collectables]\nFor some reason, the South African stuff wound up lumped together on this disc, but I swear it wasn't intentional. Miriam Makeba was a South African exile, prohibited from returning because of her stand against Apartheid. She settled at first in the U.S., ultimately leaving music for a stint as Guinean president Sekou Toure's United Nations representative. \"Maria Fulo\" is an incredible track, just a wall of percussion and some tastefully arranged horns and her voice. That voice owns the track, belting with an awe-inspiring controlled power-- it's something of a singular track in her discography, and it's definitely my favorite of hers.\n612. Youssou N'Dour & Etoile de Dakar: \"Wadiour\" [Senegal, 1982]\nAvailable on Volume 1 [Melodie], The Rough Guide to Youssou N'Dour [Rough Guides]\nI'll be honest. I don't really like Youssou N'Dour except for this song. His mbalax stuff is interesting, but I don't enjoy listening to it much, and everything from his post-Peter Gabriel days (That incredible voice at the end of \"In Your Eyes\"? That's this guy.) makes me rather ill, especially his duet with Neneh Cherry. However, \"Wadiour\" is a sweet track, charging up the mbalax sound with a dose of scratchy funk and coastal guitars. The recording has a lo-fi edge to it that actually aids the floating feel of the music, and the pitched drum interjections that define mbalax are nowhere to be heard-- those drums were actually one of the most interesting things about mbalax, but this is more of a funk track and they wouldn't fit here.\n613. Tunde Williams & Africa '70: \"Mr. Big Mouth\" [Nigeria, 1975]\nAvailable on the split release Lekan Animashaun: Low Profile/Mr. Big Mouth: Tunde Williams Plays with Africa '70 [Honest Jon's]\nAny time you hear a trumpet solo on an Africa '70 record, it's Tunde Williams. The man was a monster player and he was one of a few Fela comrades-at-arms to record some of his own music on the side. Mr. Big Mouth is a two-track album just like much of Fela's stuff, and the title track features a sturdy horn arrangement over a mid-tempo funk vamp.\nAs with Tony Allen, Williams follows Fela's political path in his lyrics, offering, \"Him be contractor/ They give am big contract/ He blow money before he start contract,\" but it's the refrain of \"He dey halla halla/ De boast boast\" that reveals him as a master hook-crafter. In an unusual move for an Africa '70 track, there is no drum kit, only hand percussion, a foreshadowing of some of Fela's later Egypt 80 material, which is ironic considering Williams didn't remain with Fela long enough to play in that band.\n614. The Funkees: \"Dancing Time\" [Nigeria, early 70s]\nAvailable on Nigeria 70: the Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\n\"It's dancin' time,\" calls the vocalist over the funky rhythms that open the song, and who am I to argue? The Funkees rose quickly from the ashes created by the Biafran War in the eastern Nigerian town of Aba, and they are emblematic of how quickly the area's Igbo population rebounded from what by all accounts was a truly horrible war. When they announce that \"dancin' time is over\" at the end of the song, it comes just a little too soon.\n__615. Ladysmith Black Mambazo: \"Lomhlaba Kawunoni [The Earth Never Gets Fat]\" [South Africa, 1987]\n__Available on Shaka Zulu [Warner]\nLadysmith Black Mambazo became international stars after their guest spots on Paul Simon's Graceland, still the best and most natural-sounding album by a Western musician to incorporate South African music. They're a Zulu a cappella choir, and it wouldn't be an insult to say they sound like dirt. There's something about the mix of voices and the calm beauty of their music that makes it feel as if the music were coming from the earth itself and had been there all along. They still tour extensively and release albums at a phenomenal clip.\n701. Girma Beyene: \"Ene Negn Bay Manesh\" [Ethiopia, 1969]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques Vol. 8: Swinging Addis [Buda Musique] and The Rough Guide to the Music of Ethiopia [Rough Guides]\nThis song is a masterpiece. It kicks in with a chunky vamp that blossoms into a majestic horn arrangement that sounds like a whole new world opening up, and its lead spot on Éthiopiques 8 is the only logical place for it to be sequenced. Beyene's vocals are the least Ethiopian of anyone in that scene, probably because he was a keyboardist and arranger first and foremost and a performer second. Both of his primary skills are on full display here, though, as his bluesy organ playing offers a sonic foil to the modal horn parts. If you ever hear only one track on this whole list, this wouldn't be a bad choice.\n702. TP Orchestre Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou Dahomey: \"Minsato Le, Mi Dayihome\" [Benin, early 70s]\nAvailable on World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing, the Funky Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa [Luaka Bop]\nBenin's greatest band are referred to by any number of variations on their lengthy name, but it's the \"TP\" that's most important. It stands for \"tout pouissant,\" or \"all-powerful.\" They began playing highlife, but in the 70s their sound got harder, and soon they were playing a unique brand of funk stuffed with snaking guitar lines and punctuated with piercing James Brown screams. The way this song wraps the lead guitar part around the beat is astounding.\n703. Sweet Talks: \"Eyi Su Ngaangaa\" [Ghana, 1976]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nThis is another furiously funky blast from the Sweet Talks, who truly had a sound all their own in the mid-70s. The organ travels down, A.B. Crentsil's vocal travels up and somewhere in the space between them horns twitch and scorching rhythms throb away. If I'm ever in Accra, I have to pick up a few of their original albums.\n704. African Brothers Band: \"Sakatumbe\" [Ghana, 1970]\nAvailable on Ghana Soundz 2: Afro-Beat, Funk & Fusion in 70s Ghana [Soundway]\nOh, man, had these guys ever been listening to James Brown. Nana Ampadu's vocal performance on this song is full of Brownian squeals and screams, and the bit where he calls out to the band and asks, \"Are you ready, fellas?\" seals the deal. The music itself is fast, heavy funk, but approaches quite differently from the way the J.B.'s might have–the guitars are lighter for one thing, but the really big difference is in the drums. This break is disgusting-- a wacked-out, octopedal snare and cymbal festival-- and these guys weren't even a funk band! African Brothers were a guitar highlife band and one of the most prolific acts in Ghana, so it's only natural that they'd try out a little funk and fusion. The only shame is that they didn't try out more of it.\n705. Dan Boadi & His African Internationals: \"Play that Funky Music\" [Ghana, 1978]\nAvailable on Money Is the Root of Evil [Hefty]\nThis song has no relation whatsoever to the massive Wild Cherry hit of the same name, though they're not very far removed in time from each other. This is from a 1978 Chicago recording session by Boadi and his band the African Internationals, and it's a pensive slow-burner full of long, searching sax lines. It never rises above a medium boil, but it doesn't need to-- a few minutes of spacey funk make for a great interlude in the middle of a disc like this.\n706. Manu Dibango: \"Mwasa Makossa\" [Cameroon, 1973]\nAvailable on Soul Makossa [Unidisc]\nThe funny thing about the success of \"Soul Makossa\" is that it's not even really an example of Manu Dibango's signature makossa groove. \"Mwasa Makossa\" captures that groove like lightning in a bottle-- it's basically a high-energy funk beat with a distinctive, ineffable rhythmic feel that no one else's music seems to have. Dibango is still doing it all these years later, and he has been since the 1950s-- looking at his recent album covers, I have to say I hope I look that good in my 60s.\n__707. George Danquah: \"Just a Moment\" [country, year unknown]\n__Available on The Danque!! [Afrodisiac]\n\"Just a Moment\" is a well-titled piece of music, because that's all it asks for. It's almost a funk collage, with scratchy guitar, soulful female backing vocals buried in the mix, a flute, congas, and a few other things congealing into a slow-moving funk instrumental that gradually organizes itself enough to throw out a pretty sweet horn arrangement.\n708. Mulatu Astatque: \"Netsanet\" [Ethiopia, 1974]\nAvailable on Éthiopiques 4: Ethio Jazz & Musique Instrumentale [Buda Musique] and AfricaFunk: The Original Sound of 1970s Funky Africa [Harmless]\nIf I've got my Amharic right, \"Netsanet\" means liberty (it's also apparently used as a woman's first name), and I suppose you might say that that's what Swinging Addis was a celebration of-- the culture of Ethiopia was opening up, and so were nightclubs and bars where the music heard on the Éthiopiques series thrived. This instrumental drips with wah pedal and organ and features one of Astatque's stateliest horn charts.\n709. Gaspar Lawal: \"Kita Kita\" [Nigeria, 1980]\nAvailable on Nigeria 70: the Definitive Story of 1970s Funky Lagos [Strut]\nAt first blush, this almost sounds South African with its bright, shiny veneer and thumping beat, but as it progresses, it morphs into a weird dub track, with the originally straightforward piano part unfurling into a layered wash and finally giving way to echoing guitars, disembodied vocal intonations, and multiplying drums. No other African track I've heard sounds anything like it.\n__710. Moussa Doumbia: \"Keleya\" [Mali, 1975]\n__Available on World Psychedelic Classics 3: Love's a Real Thing, the Funky Fuzzy Sounds of West Africa [Luaka Bop]\nIf \"unh!\" was James Brown's motto for the better part of the 70s, then \"Guhhhrrrrr!\" must have been Moussa Doumbia's. His vocal on \"Keleya\" is the gruntingest, gruffest, gnarliest one of this whole set, like 70s Tom Waits with a nasty rhythm section. He wastes no time getting to the nastiness, either, announcing the song with a gurgly shriek and then riding the organ-dominated groove with all the \"hey!\"s and \"hoo-ah!\"s he can muster. My suspicion is that he's also the sax player, because he doesn't sound like the kind of guy who could stay quiet during the solo without something to do.\n711. Fred Fisher: \"Asa-sa\" [Nigeria, 1979]\nAvailable on Afro Baby: The Evolution of the Afro Sound in Nigeria, 1970-1979 [Soundway]\nAfro-disco explosion! Fred Fisher's \"Asa-sa\" should be in every DJ's crate, and in a perfect world it would be. But in our generally mediocre real world, it's relegated to the dustbins of history until some nice folks like Miles Cleret and his Soundway cohorts dig it up. The groove is loose and crisp all the way, and the big horn hits at the 3:40 mark set up the charged last five minutes nicely. The sound doesn't have a conventional verse/chorus/verse structure, preferring to simply grow more infectious as it goes on, and that's exactly what it does.\n712. Konono No. 1: \"Paradiso\" [Democratic Republic of Congo, 2005]\nAvailable on Congotronics [Crammed Discs]\nKonono have been the subject of quite a lot of press lately, following a sudden realization by the world that they exist and are making some pretty damn cool music. Most of their recordings are of the electrified brand of Bazombo trance music that got them noticed, but \"Paradiso\" feels like a real step forward, following a harder rhythm urged along by skittering hi-hat and rolling snares. The electrified likembe of course sits at the heart of the song, creating a mind-blowing whorl of sound that sound even more impressive with the band's newfound rhythmic discipline.\n713. Fela Ransome Kuti & Africa '70: \"Water No Get Enemy\" [Nigeria, 1975]\nAvailable on Expensive Shit/He Miss Road [MCA/Universal], The Best Best of Fela [MCA/Universal], Music Is the Weapon: The Best of Fela Kuti [MCA/Universal], Two Sides of Fela: Jazz & Dance [Barclay], Essential Afrobeat: The Very Best of Afrobeat 3CD Mix [Family Recordings], Afrobeat Sessions [Sessions], and Best of the Black President [Knitting Factory]\nAll discussions of Afrobeat begin and end with Fela, even when there's plenty of good stuff in between, and this one's no different. This is the flip of the Expensive Shit album, and it's one of Fela's heaviest tracks, opening with a loping horn-and-Rhodes groove. The main horn theme is doubled by Fela's choir is the same way Sergio Mendes or Peter Thomas might have blended voices and instruments and it makes a thrilling texture, especially with Lekan Animashaun's baritone sax honking away down at the bottom.\nFranco Aboddy's bass line weaves its way through it all deftly, tying together all the percussive threads and anchoring the groove. The song is the kind of thing you can imagine lasting a full hour at the Shrine in Lagos during an all-night concert and still not being long enough. That's ultimately the genius of Fela and much of Afrobeat in general-- the groove is endless and you're just tuning in to a part of it captured on tape. I'll be tuning in often.\nSegun Okeji & Afro Super-Feelings: \"Afro Super-Feelings in Disco\" [Nigeria, late 70s?]\nAvailable on Afro [Soul Patrol]\nThis is available only on French vinyl, but it's such a killer track I thought it rounded out this set nicely. It's a side-long, disco-infused Afrobeat odyssey that grunts into action with a burst of free-jazz sax and then it's off and running with a pummeling groove, ultra-tight horns and an exuberant chorus-- it's like Fela in the club, and when Okeji sings, \"you dance to the feeling of the sound,\" you do.",

Since almost all our writers were born in the 70s and 80s, we hoped to start a dialogue among our generation about which songs from music's most exhaustively documented decade still resonate. We had a fantastic time creating the list and, judging from the reaction, many readers shared our enthusiasm.\nAlmost immediately, we received requests for the writers' individual lists. Below is the Top 10 of each writer who voted in the poll, which includes many great songs that didn't make the top 200.\nSpeaking of which, we thought it would be fun to give our contributors a chance to write about a personal favorite that didn't make the cut. So enjoy one last swing through the 60s and we'll see you back in the 21st century.\nNitsuh Abebe\n01. Andy Williams: Moon River\n02. Archie Bell & the Drells: Tighten Up\n03.

The Impressions: People Get Ready\nAndy Williams: \"Moon River\"\n(Henry Mancini/Johnny Mercer)\n1962\nAvailable on Moon River & Other Great Movie Themes\nThe 1960s was a good decade for squares, and there's any number of box-shaped pop songs I'd have loved to see on our list: \"Downtown\", \"Blue Moon\", \"Danke Schoen\". The killer among them, though, is this foghorn rendering of \"Moon River\", the best song ever kind of made up by Truman Capote. His Breakfast at Tiffany's put Holly Golightly out on the fire escape singing \"harsh-tender wandering tunes with words that smacked of pineywoods or prairie\"-- in other words, country songs. Mancini and Mercer's film theme does the same thing to the country song that the film does to the book, lavishing it with strings and glamour and insisting on its heterosexuality. But that high-lonesome harmonica drives home what's underneath.\nThis is a song about dreaming of escaping to someplace beautiful and better, someplace \"waiting 'round the bend\" where you'll finally be content-- one of a few reasons I used to love Morrissey's version, back when I was in high school and itching to leave town. But the burr in the song's heart is that that place never magically arrives; it never ever will. And once you realize that, this tune changes: It stops being a Hollywood dream and turns back to the incredibly sad, wounded, lopsided lament Holly sang in print. It's a song of yearning for impossible dreams, and that damned harmonica seems to know it.\nZach Baron\n01. Sam Cooke: A Change Is Gonna Come\n02. Bob Dylan: Like a Rolling Stone\n03.

Johnny and June Carter Cash: Jackson\nJohn Fahey: \"In Christ There Is No East or West\"\n(Fahey)\n1967\nAvailable on The Legend of Blind Joe Death\nAs close to a single or signature song as Fahey got, \"In Christ\" was included on his first record, Blind Joe Death, and would later play, more than 40 years later, at his funeral. Fahey got the tune from his childhood Episcopal hymnal, and recorded it incessantly. Then and now, \"In Christ\" is so simple as to be nearly transparent-- Fahey, depending on the year, the day, the hour, could play it as solemnly as a wake or as playfully as the country rags it evokes. Absent of both the musique concrète, experimental spirit of his later work and his constant, endlessly sinister, almost-suicidal bass drones, the track is nevertheless remarkable for how consistently-- and to vastly different effect-- Fahey could control the mood of his work. He did so by varying not single notes, but the elegantly shaped spaces between them. \"In Christ\" was always moving, always in a different way.\nStuart Berman\n01.

The Velvet Underground: Sister Ray\n__The Music Machine: \"Talk Talk\"\n__ (Sean Bonniwell)\n1966\nAvailable on Turn On: The Best of the Music Machine\n\"Nuggets\" has become rock-critic shorthand for \"snotty 60s garage-rock,\" to the point where it's easy to forget that everyone's got different snot, from the bad-trip breakdowns of the 13th Floor Elevators to the maximum r&Beatles of the Knickerbockers to the proto-metal of the Amboy Dukes. But if we are to reduce the entire Nuggets ethos to one song, this is it. True to Nuggets' deification of the amateur, the Music Machine sound like they were barely six months out of high-school band class: The opening two-note organ riff even sounds kinda dorky, but then locks into a menacing goosestep that hits like bare fists on a frozen meat slab. The song is all verse, no chorus; all tension, no release. Smug-thug frontman Sean Bonniwell rants about no one and nothing in particular, getting so worked up, in fact, that he can't even form a coherent sentence: \"Can't seem to talk about...the things that bother me...seem to be...what everybody has...against me!\" Back in the days before cusswords in pop songs began commonplace, this was how you told someone to shut the fuck up.\nTom Breihan\n01.

Desmond Dekker Israelites\nThe Chiffons: \"Nobody Knows What's Goin' On (In My Mind But Me)\"\n(Brute Force)\n1965\nAvailable on One Fine Day\nNever a big hit (it topped out at #49 in 1965), this has a glorious, ostentatious sweep that damn near justifies the existence of the entire reissue industry. It's less than two-and-a-half minutes long, but impossibly lavish: murmuring psych-bass, regal bursts of horn, fluttering windchimes, razor-sharp drum-thwacks, a swooshing harp, all those layers piled up precariously on top of each other to the point where it's amazing that it doesn't all just fall apart. But all those bells and whistles serve a heartrendingly simple lyrical conceit: girl is in love, everyone thinks the guy is no good, girl doesn't listen. That's the plotline of roughly half of the era's girl-group hits, but here it's no specifics, all emotion. On the intro, it's a dreamy murk, Judy Craig sighing the title to herself over and over again while the other Chiffons' voices float around her. And then it snaps into a joyous stomp of a chorus: \"And I love him,\" like those four words are enough to bring clarity roaring back.\nCory D. Byrom\n01. The Beatles: A Day in the Life\n02.

Merle Haggard: Mama Tried\nCream: \"Sunshine of Your Love\"\n(Jack Bruce, Pete Brown, Eric Clapton)\n1968\nAvailable on Disraeli Gears\nA music deconstructionist's wet dream, \"Sunshine of Your Love\" is built with such precision that sometimes it's more fun to focus on the individual parts than on the song as a whole. Ginger Baker's relentless rhythm and the fuzzy warble of Jack Bruce's bass can get pushed aside in favor of Eric Clapton's much-imitated guitar tone, but all three musicians deserve credit for this one. Still, it's hard to deny Clapton's power. The guitar solo twists \"Blue Moon\", juxtaposing it with this heavy blues shuffle barking out one of the most recognizable riffs in rock's sordid history. This song does rock, metal, blues, and psychedelia all at the same time, and better than the seemingly endless parade of bands who built careers imitating the sound.\nChris Dahlen\n01.

To be frank, this classic rock mainstay has grown deeply unfashionable in indiedom. And you can put most of the blame on Jim. Scruffy, drunk men screaming bad poetry are out, and ever since Kurt Cobain, rocking hard and dying young doesn't seem romantic so much as dumb.\nBut forget the witchcraft rumors, the dead Indians, and the quotes in junior high yearbooks: The Doors left behind two or three strong albums, some credible white boy blues, and a string of classic singles-- particularly \"Light My Fire\". The jam in the middle was too much for the radio edit, but each solo's a note-for-note classic-- Ray Manzarek's fierce and melodic organ improvisation, followed by Robby Krieger's smoking, macho-in-his-own-mind fretwork, build the song to a back-clawing climax before Morrison waltzes in for the close. Listen with fresh ears and you'll discover that Jimbo and crew became icons for all the wrong reasons-- and there's nothing dated about a performance like this.\nStephen M. Deusner\n01.

Johnny Cash: Folsom Prison Blues (live)\nThe Bar-Kays: \"Soul Finger\"\n(James Alexander/Ronnie Caldwell/Ben Cauley/Carl Cunningham/Phalon Jones/Jimmy King)\n1967\nAvailable on Soul Finger\n\"Soul Finger\" is the epitome of the in-studio spontaneity that helped make Stax a soul powerhouse. According to Rob Bowman's excellent history Soulsville, U.S.A., the band based the main melody on Ben Cauley's jazzed-up \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\". And David Porter came up with the title and coaxed some kids hanging out in front of the studio to chant it in the studio. He reportedly paid them in Coca-Cola.\nThe result is surprising: The Bar-Kays managed to surpass their mentors the MGs and record arguably the best Stax instrumental ever put to tape. Cauley's punchy fanfare leads perfectly into the vertiginous horn vibrato of the main melody, and Jimmy King's guitar solo makes no bones about nicking from MG and mentor Steve Cropper (wish more players would). But it's the irresistible groove that makes the song a party-starting classic. Its pull is gravitational, that weighty bassline falling ineluctably earthward then bouncing back up. Those kids are part of the groove: their enthusiasm not only propels the band onward as surely as Carl Cunningham's drums, but they make \"Soul Finger\" sound like one of the most haplessly infectious songs of the decade.\nRyan Dombal\n01.

Much of the credit goes to Joe Meek, the crackpot producer who helmed this beyond-the-grave back-and-forth. Leyton's acting background helps him sell poetic eulogies like, \"I'll hear her singing in the sighing of the wind/ Blowin' in the treetops way above me,\" but it's the apparitional female callbacks that truly creep down the spine. Bottom line: Is the song a telltale confession of a cold-blooded killer haunted by a tragic crime of passion? Johnny's not saying. But the tinge of horror in his lover's refrain is searing, damning proof.\nSean Fennessey\n01. Sam Cooke: A Change Is Gonna Come\n02. The Meters: Cissy Strut\n03. Leonard Cohen: Suzanne\n04.

Sly & the Family Stone: Hot Fun in the Summertime\nLittle Stevie Wonder: \"Fingertips (Pt. 2)\"\n(Clarence Paul/Henry Cosby)\n1963\nAvailable on Recorded Live: The 12 Year Old Genius\nThe first live single to ever hit number one in the U.S., only Motown's second chart-topper ever (after the Marvelettes' \"Please Mr. Postman\"), and most people have never even heard \"Part 1\". \"Fingertips (Pt. 2)\" was recorded at Chicago's Regal Theatre when Wonder was just 12 years old and there has never been another hit that sounds like it. Before Motown had perfected its songwriting formula, the Ray Charles-inspired Wonder released this psychotically delivered, structurally irregular call-and-response track; though it launched his career, it still sounds like a fluke.\nThe song begins with a euphoric, improvising Wonder yelping \"Everybody say yeah!\" to which an audience seemingly made of pre-teens shouts back at him \"Yeah!\" Then, battling a big band squall, he plays an overwhelming string of bluesy harmonica, while stringing together nonsensical phrases meant to rile his listeners. After an MC attempts to wrap things up, Wonder starts in again, and you can hear staggered bassist Larry Moses ask \"What key? What key?\" before Stevie whips his voice around and shout-sings \"Goodbye, Goodbye\" before closing it out. It's a song about nothing and everything: Yes, it's lyrically empty and screeching, but it also overflows with youth's explosive optimism. It stands to me as Motown's most exciting recorded moment.\nJess Harvell\n01. The Ronettes: Be My Baby\n02. The Trashmen: Surfin' Bird\n03. The Beach Boys: God Only Knows\n04.

Like, the sweet hereafter may be the bee's knees, but whatever: \"Who needs paradise?/ I'd rather have you,\" Fairweather-Low proclaims. It gets almost too perfect when he acknowledges the splashy orchestration: \"When you are around/ My heart always pounds/ Just like a brass band.\" Like a cross between the \"Hey Jude\" coda and a drunken \"Auld Lang Syne\", with vocals reminiscent of B.J. Thomas in the original \"Hooked on a Feeling\" and Neil Diamond in a thousand hits, \"Half as Nice\" sounds halfway between heaven and Earth, except probably kinda closer to heaven.\nBrian Howe\n01.

Like Don Van Vliet's own slavering id, off-kilter licks threaten to pull apart at the seams and spill out something appalling, with a jazzy complexity that predicted the American math-rock of the 1990s as precisely as Van Vliet's hallucinatory language and dramatically mangled inflections augured Tom Waits's beautiful crack-up of the 80s. The song is a seedy alley through which Ella Guru saunters, while Beefheart play the roles of catcalling, catastrophically impaired undesirables. Van Vliet alternates between pushy lothario and cowardly letch, muttering obscurely to his Magic Band from the corner of his mouth (\"That's right, 'The Mascara Snake'/ Fast and bulbous/ Tight also\"); guitarist Jeff Cotton gibbers at Ella like someone with feces on his mouth. This is pretty much \"Girl From Ipanema\", except, you know-- batshit insane.\nDominique Leone\n01. The Beach Boys: God Only Knows\n02. The Rolling Stones: You Can't Always Get What You Want\n03.

Fifties sensation (and not necessarily 1969's hottest pop commodity) Peggy Lee understood. Actually, Lee licensed legendary songwriters Jerry Leiber's and Mike Stoller's understanding, but listening to her smoky, proto-MILF purr reveal her most devastating interpersonal disasters before realizing she's bored of them indicates the kind of real cynicism only a lifetime of slight disappointments can provide.

But \"A Quick One (While He's Away)\", even swollen as it is to nearly nine minutes, doesn't deserve to be lumped into the latter group. Townshend's first hack at musical storytelling plants a foot in each era of the band's long history, combining the bratty, Monty Python humor of the early Who (girl guides and engine drivers, wtf?) with the group's aspirations-to-come. Here, the TV-show live version is definitive, mixed to put Keith Moon's spectacular clatter at the forefront and making the delirious choral-round peak of the \"You Are Forgiven\" section one of the band's greatest windmilling moments.\nAdam Moerder\n01.

But on an album stacked with timeless songwriting and drop-dead performances from Dusty, the Goffin/King-penned \"No Easy Way Down\" rises above the others for devastating heartache. Dusty may have lacked the range of her contemporaries, but her voice projected more than enough raw emotion to earn the term \"soul\". After the even pacing of the first two verses and choruses, Dusty takes the song to its turning point, singing, \"No, it isn't very easy/ When each road you take is another mistake\" like she's about to become unhinged with sorrow. The string and horn arrangements are both mesmerizing, but it's Dusty's voice that sweeps you away during these three perfectly bittersweet minutes.\nMatthew Murphy\n01.

Patsy Cline: Crazy\nKaleidoscope: \"Jenny Artichoke\"\n(Peter Daltrey/Eddie Pumer)\n1968\nAvailable on Tangerine Dream\nThe English quartet Kaleidoscope-- not to be confused with the U.S. act of the same name and vintage-- came up through the same London club scene that generated Pink Floyd and Traffic. Indebted to Donovan and the early Bee Gees, the group's 1967 debut album Tangerine Dream fizzled on the pop charts, so in 1968 Kaleidoscope returned to the studio to cut the most deliberately commercial single they could devise. The chief result of this session was \"Jenny Artichoke,\" a glorious piece of psych-pop bubblegum that celebrates the hi-jinks of its seaside heroine (\"Climbing up a flagpole! Looking through a porthole!\") in all her whimsical British splendor. Unfortunately, this buoyant, melodic single again failed to dent the charts. Frustrated by their lack of popular success, Kaleidoscope eventually changed their name to Fairfield Parlour and somehow managed to become even more foppish and eccentric. As for \"Jenny Artichoke\", nearly 40 years later the question still stands: How could anyone ever pass by her?\nAmy Phillips\n01. Creedence Clearwater Revival: Fortunate Son\n02.

David Bowie: Space Oddity\nWilson Pickett: \"In the Midnight Hour\"\n(Wilson Pickett/Steve Cropper)\n1965\nAvailable on Wilson Pickett's Greatest Hits\nMuch of the power of \"In the Midnight Hour\" is left to the imagination. What, exactly, is he going to do to her? Why does it have to wait until the dead of night? And why is he so damn happy about it?\nThe clues are there in the hip-thrusting low end, the sweat-stained horns, and Pickett's slightly scorched vocals; something very, very nasty is about to go down, but revealing too much would take all the fun out of it. Somehow, Wilson Pickett simultaneously earns his \"wicked\" nickname while making most modern booty call songs sound desperate and slutty by comparison.\nScott Plagenhoef\n01.

Frank Sinatra: It Was a Very Good Year\nFrank Sinatra: \"My Way\"\n(Paul Anka)\n1969\nAvailable on My Way\nAlongside Paul Anka, Frank Sinatra adapted the stubborn man's deathbed power play of \"My Way\" from Claude Francoix's \"Comme d'habitude\" in 1968, and recorded it the following year, at the age of 54. By the time he was on his actual deathbed nearly three decades later, he'd renounced the song as an embarrassingly self-indulgent and (somewhat) youthful indiscretion. The blustery, know-it-all ego trip had little bearing on the practicalities and sacrifices of everyday life, but became, by virtue of its uncanny ability to convincingly catch an entire life in a bottle in under four minutes (and thus succeed where 99.9983% of pop songs fail), perversely cemented in the public consciousness as emblematic of Sinatra's own real-life legacy.\nEven forgetting about Sid Vicious, the mafia, the Cold War and all the other remote nodes that \"My Way\" invariably found itself connected to over the next forty years, that right there is a fantastically complicated dynamic, one bursting with all kinds of textually rich subplots; young Frank vs. old, the emptiness of legacy, the loneliness of ego, what's true in life vs. what's true in song. By beginning like an infant's lullaby, closing like the gates of heaven and announcing itself by declaring the end is near, it complicates things one step further, playing with time in a way that suggests immortality is in fact its birthright. Complex and endearingly human, it's also one of the biggest-sounding songs I've ever heard.\nDavid Raposa\n01. Sly & the Family Stone: Hot Fun in the Summertime\n02.

Stevie Wonder: For Once in My Life\nThe Zombies: \"Time of the Season\"\n(Rod Argent)\n1969\nAvailable on Odessey and Oracle\nThe wet clap followed by that soft release of breath, the reverberation of the two snare hits at the start of every measure, the ghostly echo in the call-and-response vocals, even the faux-Gregorian harmonies in the chorus-- for at least part of one song, the Zombies managed to evoke an atmosphere befitting their name. With the talk of love running high and Colin Blunstone asking \"What's your name?\" and \"Who's your daddy?\" like a big bad wolf stalking after a red-hooded girl, one might expect this tune to fit right into the soundtrack of a high-minded slasher flick. And, of course, the groovy organ-break-a-go-go is when the blood finally starts pouring and the guys go for the arm-stretch-reacharound on their grossed-out girlfriends.\nMark Richardson\n01.

The Monkees: Daydream Believer\nThe Trashmen: \"Surfin' Bird\"\n(Al Frazier/Carl White/John Harris/Turner Wilson)\n1964\nAvailable on Surfin' Bird\nGrowing up I heard about how rock'n'roll offended adult sensibilities, forever cleaving Western culture into young and old. The parents just couldn't understand the hopped-up music the kids were dancing to; they wanted Perry Como and Andy Williams and smoothness and grace. And the songs used as examples of the generational schism, things like \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On\" and \"Jailhouse Rock\" and \"Johnny B. Goode\", well...great music, all, but I could never quite wrap my ahead around why this new pop seemed so distasteful to so many. I understood the rift as history, because I'd read about it in books, but couldn't understand it emotionally. Was it really so strange?\nSometimes. Take \"Surfin' Bird\", which mashes together two songs by the far-more-respectable doo-wop group the Rivingtons. Like \"Louie Louie\", it's simple, loud, and sloppy. But when you add Dal Winslow's voice, just so leering, sounding for all the world like a sex fiend on drugs with his tongue hanging out, the generation gap makes more sense. I can picture the button-down authority figures listening to this song and grimly shaking their heads, imagining the bleak future fans of this music would usher in. But they didn't get it. Winslow wasn't singing about a dance craze called \"The Bird\", he was pointing out this thing that kids felt but couldn't articulate. \"The bird\" was code for a new freedom that only mid-century teenagers could understand. There was a whole world behind those two words, a world invisible to parents that would become much clearer as the decade wore on. The \"bird,\" you know? Papa oom-mow-mow! You know what I'm saying? Sure, sure, I get it. And I do, finally: This must have driven the grown-ups crazy.\nRyan Schreiber\n01. The Beatles: I Am the Walrus\n02. Sam Cooke: A Change Is Gonna Come\n03.

The resulting sheen of drone-based minimalism taps a quantifiable transcendence. I've listened to that hectic, dozy, rapid swarm more times than I can count; still, when the buzz cuts out at 32:25, my heartbeat flatlines. Amazingly, \"Four Violins\" is Conrad's only extended solo violin work from the period; he was otherwise collaborating on \"dream music\" with John Cale, Angus MacLise, La Monte Young, and Marian Zazeela in the Dream Syndicate aka the Theatre of Eternal Music. Two years later, outside that crew (he, Cale, and MacLise split by the end of 1965), he initiated seizures with the 30-minute black/white stroboscopic 16-mm film, The Flicker.

Los Zafiros (the Sapphires) were the anomaly within the anomaly, openly flaunting American doo-wop and r&b in their sound, with occasional electric guitar to boot. \"Bossa Cubana\" is a nearly arbitrary choice for me-- they had a couple dozen songs that I cherish. Their music was as prismatic as their name suggested, melodies filtered through stunning four-part harmonies, rhythms that stirred jazz and r&b with Cuban son and mambo and Brazilian samba and bossa, and a nearly indescribable sense of nocturnal atmosphere. \"Bossa Cubana\" is their most expressionistic creation, riding a rollercoaster rhythm and Manuel Galban's strangely colored electric guitar. The backing vocals travel a mile a minute to support searching Miguelito's falsetto, and they add exotic noises with their mouths to simulate a midnight run through the jungle. It's sonically arresting and unique, much like the musical circumstances that birthed it.",

The way it saturates radio and commercial spaces, seemingly starting earlier each fall, it can feel inescapable—and a lot of it can be trite. So it’s easy to feel disenchanted. But when it came time to put together a list of our holiday favorites, we were surprised that even some of our most dedicated freaks of outré sound still had a warm place in their hearts for this music. So we polled our contributors for the best and most interesting holiday tracks, and here are the results.\nBut first, here to share her earliest holiday memories is a legend of Christmas music...\nSANTA ON MY MIND\nBy Ronnie Spector\nThere are two passions that have remained with me since I was a little girl growing up in Spanish Harlem: performing, specifically singing rock’n’roll onstage, and Christmas. I don’t recall which came first.\nI guess entertaining my family did. My uncle would put a lightbulb in an old Maxwell House coffee tin; that would be my spotlight and I would jump up on the table and sing. I was 5 years old.\nAround that time, I remember reading a book about Christmas in our apartment. On the page was Santa with his snow-white beard, in his red suit with fluffy white trim, sitting on his sleigh with a giant sack of toys. Wow! I flipped a few more pages, and I saw Santa’s black boots coming down the fireplace. Oh no—I didn’t understand this. How would I get my toys if we didn’t have a chimney, let alone a fireplace? I jumped up, ran out of the room, calling, “Daddy, Daddy!” My dad answered: “Yes, Butchie?” I asked frantically, “How is Santa going to get here with my toys, Daddy? We don’t have a fireplace.” Daddy looked at me and said, “Don’t worry, Butchie, when Santa is in New York City, he uses the fire escape.” Oh boy, what a relief! I ran into the kitchen, got out the milk and cookies, put them out on the fire escape, and went to bed dreaming of Santa. And I have been dreaming ever since.\nRonnie, left, with her sister (and future fellow Ronette) Estelle on tricycle\nEvery September, I started getting the Christmas itch. I couldn’t wait to go with my dad over to Broadway to pick out our tree, and then I made my mom take me down to Macy’s so I could sit on Santa’s lap. There was a long line of people—I couldn’t even see Santa. My mom was a waitress, and on her feet all day, but she didn’t want to disappoint me. When I finally got my chance, wearing my red dress, I’d jump onto Santa’s lap and start telling him about the doll I wanted for Christmas. Then he told me I would get it if I was a good girl—but instead, once, I got a Kewpie doll. Oy!\nBack in the late ’40s, the Christmas music on the radio was all standards, such as Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby. My parents liked that, but not me. I think the first Christmas record I liked was “White Christmas” by the Drifters. It tells you both things you need to make a great Christmas record: a good singer and a great arrangement. You hear that deep voice of Bill Pinkney of the Drifters in the beginning, and then, all of a sudden, that joyful and amazing voice of Clyde McPhatter coming in: “I-yay-yay I’m dreaming…”\nThe Ronettes' cover of Elegant Teen magazine, 1966\nI was lucky enough to record about nine or 10 Christmas records, and six of them get played on the radio still. But it’s the ones I recorded with my group the Ronettes in 1963 that will probably outlive me, and it’s because of the incredible arrangements of Jack Nitzsche. Just listen to “Sleigh Ride”—that says it all.\nJust like when I was a kid, I still wait for Christmas each year—for the brightly colored lights, Frosty the Snowman, and Santa. And the best Christmas gift for me is when I am driving at home in Connecticut to get milk and cookies for Santa, I turn on the radio and hear my version of “I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus”…and I think to myself, Santa has been pretty good to me all these years.\nRonnie Spector is a singer-songwriter, author, and the lead vocalist of the Ronettes.\n“Silver Bells”\n50\nThe Flaming Lips may employ roadies dressed like Santa Claus and have a high-concept, low-budget sci-fi film called Christmas on Mars, but they only have one holiday album—sort of. Released initially under the name Imagene Peise, Atlas Eets Christmas treats “Silver Bells” and other familiar tracks like the mid-century pop standards they are. Centered around the piano of Steven Drozd and blurred together by a fake vinyl crackle, other accoutrements like mellotron, sitar, and bells leak in subtly, as if barely there at all.\nAccording to the liner notes, “Peise” released his collection of “Iraqi piano jazz” before committing suicide in 1978; the Lips’ weirdness, however, remains eternal. Like a prankster trying to keep a straight face, or strange hallucinations flickering at the periphery of one’s vision, Atlas Eets Christmas sounds beamed in from the universe next door, where the holiday traditions are all the same but the color scheme is different. –Jesse Jarnow\nListen: The Flaming Lips/Imagene Peise: “Silver Bells”\n“Christmas in Harlem” [ft. Cam’ron, Jim Jones, Vado, Cyhi da Prynce, Pusha T, Musiq Soulchild, Teyana Taylor and Big Sean]\n49\nThis is arguably the best “holidays come to the ’hood” song of all time (sorry, “Christmas in Hollis”). The soulful swag of Teyana Taylor’s vocals glazing Kanye West’s Marvin Gaye-sampling production might lead you to believe this 2010 posse carol exists outside of time (and outside of the internet—the original extended cut is nowhere to be found online, replaced with Kanye’s retail non-Dipset-and-friends edit), that it’s been preserved inside a snowglobe where Cam’ron braves the swirling flakes in a white fur cape and ushanka as he strolls regally past a miniature Apollo Theatre. Jim Jones peers from a shop window in his Hennessy-stained Santa suit, which hangs open to reveal his Dipset chain. Despite Jones’ red-rimmed eyes, he is a reassuring presence, making sure all the kids have toys, growling, “Let’s make a toast ’cause Christ is born/We gon’ party ’otil the lights come on.” Whatever your spiritual outlook or geographic location, just shake this little ball of silvery bling any time you need to be reminded: It’s a wonderful night to be alive, baby. –Edwin “STATS” Houghton\n“Back Door Santa”\n48\nClarence Carter worked his way up the ranks at the legendary Muscle Shoals soul studio into Atlantic Records’ roster; there, his pleading love songs (“Slip Away,” “Too Weak to Fight”) cracked through the R&B charts and into pop crossover fame. His entry for Atlantic’s Soul Christmas collection is more Penthouse letter than romance novel, though. It’s a hectic, slyly salacious effort: Alongside a blaring horn intro (that would later be sampled on Run-DMC’s “Christmas In Hollis”), Carter packs military drum rolls, casual down-home asides (“Lookit here!”), classic blues progressions, and enough raunchy imagery to stuff a stocking. (He flits between embracing the “back door,” giving ladies his “presents,” and needling St. Nick for only coming once a year.) If you’re sick of Christmas commercialism, Carter—who still tours today at 80 years old—can be doubly appreciated for his randy embrace of the season. –Jason Gross\nListen: Clarence Carter: “Back Door Santa”\n“Christmas in the Room”\n47\nSince 2001, Sufjan Stevens has recorded and released more than 100 Christmas songs. But the Christian artist isn’t just reeling off reams of standards to satiate the faithful, or cashing in with big band renditions like some kind of Perry Como in a tight thrift-store tee. Instead, he often spikes his holiday tunes—both originals and covers—with the season’s signature blend of conflicted feelings. These odes bring out the comforting smell of pine needles along with the dampness of slushy socks, the merry warmth of generosity as well as the nagging nostalgia of those childhood revelries of yore.\n“Christmas in the Room,” Stevens’ best Yuletide original, is about a couple trying to conjure the holiday spirit without all of the typical trappings: “No parties planned, no place to go/It’s just the two of us alone.” The bare instrumentation matches the mood, with Stevens’ acoustic guitar soundtracking a Christmas without mistletoe, malls, silver bells, Santa, or even family. The idea seems so simple and yet so stark: The holiday is what you make of it, and the spirit can be found in another person, within four walls. –Ryan Dombal\nListen: Sufjan Stevens: “Christmas in the Room”\n“Happy Christmas”\n46\nChristmas is bashment time in Jamaica, and every holiday season sees a wave of new tunes and choreography unveiled at the massive dances held in celebration. The result is a deep catalog of island holiday classics spanning decades and styles, ranging from reggae-fied versions of the standards to original badman carols.\nToots & the Maytals’ “Happy Christmas” stands head, shoulders, and lung-power above the rest. (It’s on the Dynamic Sounds compilation Christmas in the Tropics—worth tracking down for the cover alone.) The country chapel brand of gospel that powers Toots lends itself perfectly to the Christmas theme; his booming Pentecostalist fervor, underpinned by church bells and skanking guitar, is guaranteed to transform the stiffest office holiday party into a hand-clapping revival meeting. –Edwin “STATS” Houghton\nListen: Toots & the Maytals: “Happy Christmas”\n“Christmas in New Orleans”\n45\nLouis Armstrong recorded several holiday numbers—this one, written by Richard Sherman and Joseph Van Winkle, has the distinction of containing some of Satchmo’s ecstatic, bluesy swagger. (Not always a guarantee, in the field of theme and novelty recordings.) Officially a collaboration between the jazz virtuoso and Benny Carter’s orchestra, this performance is mostly led by Armstrong’s “All Stars” ensemble; that working band had just produced two buoyant LPs for Columbia, and the support they offer Armstrong here keeps the track from becoming too cutesy. Pianist Billy Kyle plays the blues behind Armstrong’s gravelly verses, and drummer Barrett Deems provides subtle but authoritative swing during the bandleader’s trumpet solo. Thirty years after Armstrong changed jazz forever with his first singles, his technique here proves that he was still a gift not only to the sound of New Orleans but to the rest of the world—and to the holidays, to boot. –Seth Colter Walls\nListen: Louis Armstrong: “Christmas in New Orleans”\n“Carol of the Bells a.k.a. Opera of the Bells”\n44\nIn 2001, Destiny’s Child were the biggest girl-group in pop, presiding with three-part harmonies, deconstructed R&B, and sharp celebrations of autonomy and self-love. That spring, the trio released their third studio album, *Survivor—*their first with the classic lineup of Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams, and an adventurous blend of hip-hop, soul, blues, and gospel.\nDuring a year that took the trio around the world, they also found time to record 8 Days of Christmas, a 12-track album that mixes holiday standards with originals. It’s similarly wide-ranging, full of joy and tension, rich harmonies, and percussive vocal lines. The singers share lead duties, and it’s also one of the first times the world heard from Beyonce’s 15-year-old sister, Solange, in a smooth take on “Little Drummer Boy.” Its highlight is the group’s epic a cappella rendering of the ominous Christmas classic “Carol of the Bells,” here retitled “Carol of the Bells a.k.a. Opera of the Bells.” In its grand sweep, Destiny’s Child belt out lush chords and bustling staccato melodies, weaving in and out of each other with weight and light. It’s 8 Days of Christmas’ closing track, but an apt entry point into an essential collection. –Liz Pelly\nListen: Destiny’s Child: “Carol of the Bells a.k.a. Opera of the Bells”\n“Hard Candy Christmas”\n43\nDolly Parton has recorded enough holiday material to keep an enthusiast occupied until Valentine’s Day, but her cover of “Hard Candy Christmas,” written by Carol Hall for the 1978 musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, feels particularly potent. It’s not an overt holiday song, but ever since Parton recorded the track for its film adaptation, it has become a country staple in December, and its meditation on keeping a stiff upper lip is worth internalizing as 2016 comes to a long-awaited end.\nWhat starts as an acoustic dirge about uncertainty becomes a twangy anthem for accepting and adapting to changed circumstances: “I'll be fine and dandy/Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas/I'm barely getting through tomorrow/But still I won't let/Sorrow bring me way down,” she muses. While some of the best holiday tracks focus on the sneaky sadness of forced holiday cheer, Parton’s tremulous declaration adds some much-needed optimism to what can be a wholly depressive season. Plus, frankly, there just aren’t enough Christmas songs about prostitutes. –Cady Drell\nListen: Dolly Parton: “Hard Candy Christmas”\n“To Heck With Ole Santa Claus”\n42\nThe always prolific Loretta Lynn released three albums in 1966—including her chart-topping, You Ain’t Woman Enough that September. The following month, she released Country Christmas, which was filled mostly with staples like “Away in a Manger” and “White Christmas.” But the enduring song from the release is one of a handful of original compositions written by Lynn, “To Heck With Ole Santa Claus.”\nTwangy and brimming with country sass, “To Heck With Ole Santa Claus” is explicitly about wishing ill will on the chimney-hopper who holds out on bringing her presents. More subtly, it’s a song about seasonal disappointments, holiday childishness, and not getting the thing you hoped for most on Christmas Day. As Lynn sings, “When he goes dashin’ through the snow, I hope he falls,” it’s almost pouty. She is snotty and petulant, with snappy quips that seek bodily harm as cosmic justice for being duped, but she’s redeemed by her bittersweet cheekiness. –Sheldon Pearce\nListen: Loretta Lynn: “To Heck With Ole Santa Claus”\n“What Christmas Means to Me”\n41\n“What Christmas Means to Me” is Wonder’s signature Christmas statement; in it, he seeks to define nothing less than Christmas spirit itself. It was co-written by Anna Gordy Gaye—elder sister of Motown founder Berry Gordy, and inspiration for her ex-husband Marvin Gaye’s Here, My Dear—as well as George Gordy and Allen Story. The song was released on Wonder’s only Christmas album, Someday at Christmas, alongside such other Yuletide staples as “The Little Drummer Boy” and “Silver Bells.”\nWonder sets a placid scene in “What Christmas Means to Me”: carolers trudging door-to-door through the snow, the fluorescent glow of ornaments strung together, filling the tree with “angel hair.” These things remind most of us of Christmas—the sights, sounds, and smells surrounding any nativity scene, the warmth emanating from hearth and home. But those are set dressings for more intangible things Wonder craves, in which his vocals truly soar: “Even though I love ya madly/ It seems I love you more/ And little cards you give me/ Will touch my heart for sure.” In his joy, he lands on the feelings we all revel in from the holidays: being eager, being giddy, being loved. –Sheldon Pearce\nListen: Stevie Wonder: “What Christmas Means to Me”\n“White Christmas”\n40\nYou could be forgiven for reading this cover title as an ironic selection from the band, given the amount of spiritual energy both reggae and Rastafarianism have invested in uncoupling the equation of “white” with purity and “black” with sin. But the earnest, vulnerable rasp of a young Bob Marley sandpapers away any possibility of ironic distance when the needle drops on this rocksteady gem. The slow, doo-wop and jazz-inflected skank of the Wailers in their The Birth of a Legend phase transports listeners of any nationality to the simpler optimism of post-independence Jamaica, tinged with the wistfulness of a teenager in love—or in this case, one’s who’s never seen snow, dreaming of postcard-perfect prosperity. –Edwin “STATS” Houghton\nListen: Bob Marley & the Wailers: “White Christmas”\nAaliyah performs in 1998; Photo by Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images\n“The Christmas Song”\n39\nNo other singer could deliver this definitive version of “The Christmas Song,” could combine the understated warmth of Nat King Cole’s 1961 recording with the heartbreaking power of a little girl singing in church. The 18-year-old Aaliyah’s flawless, subtly ornamented performance for First Couple Bill and Hillary Clinton is laced with revelations. First: The core of her pop success, underneath all the tomboy clothes and edginess, rested on Whitney Houston-levels of vocal talent and control. Another: While previous versions of the tune may still be grandfathered in, she effectively retired its jersey with this performance. By the time Aaliyah dances around the notes of the last “to you” in perfect pitch, even Santa Claus believes in her. –Edwin “STATS” Houghton\nListen: Aaliyah: “The Christmas Song” [Live]\n“2000 Miles”\n38\n“2000 Miles” isn’t a Christmas song in the traditional sense. It isn’t even as much about Christmas as it is the many things the holiday can represent symbolically for someone in mourning: a period of rebirth, a catalyst for reminiscence, a minefield of triggers, or all three. More than anything, though, it’s about the insurmountable distance of loss, and the intense emotional state of managing grief while surrounded by revelers.\nChrissie Hynde wrote “2000 Miles” after Pretenders’ founding guitarist James Honeyman-Scott died of heart failure induced by cocaine use. The song seems to eulogize the late musician, likening a nostalgic, dreamlike state to that Christmas feeling. “In these frozen and silent nights/Sometimes in a dream you appear/Outside under the purple sky… It felt like Christmas time,” Hynde sings. It’s a touching tribute to holidays spent missing someone just out of reach. –Sheldon Pearce\nListen: The Pretenders: “2000 Miles”\n“What Child Is This?”\n37\nWho could accomplish the seemingly impossible feat of making Christmas music sound strange and alien? Who could scour off the mustiness of Hallmark cards and plastic wreaths and bring back the scent of barn hay, the urgency of a huddled family, the auspiciousness of a fragile birth? John Fahey’s inimitable guitar arrangements of Christmas standards sound like a church we’ve never entered, the one united in profound, inexpressible feeling.\n“What Child Is This?” in particular brings this mythical feeling to the fore: It is slowed down to a near-hallucinatory tempo, as if it is being distantly remembered instead of merely played, and given a near-funereal pallor. It conjures the frightening seriousness that some of this music can impart to little children, with its transcendent and apocalyptic overtones. What was once a jingle is once again a draft of cold air from the beyond. –Jayson Greene\nListen: John Fahey: “What Child Is This?”\n“Frosty the Snowman”\n36\nFew musical styles conjure the shimmering feeling of snowfall like dream-pop, and few artists have painted dream-pop in more mesmerizing abstractions than Cocteau Twins. In the early 1990s, after releasing their landmark album Heaven or Las Vegas, the group moved to London to work on the album Four-Calendar Café. In that three-year span, they released only two songs, including this holiday staple, a take on “Frosty the Snowman” that beams with the Scottish group’s typically lush, droning guitars and translucent harmonies.\nAccording to bassist Simon Raymonde, after he wrote down the lyrics and showed them to Elizabeth Fraser, they had a good laugh: “As we were going through it, I was listening to Liz’s reactions and thinking, this is never gonna get done. She was going, ‘He’s a very happy soul’—me sing that?! No way, I could not in a million years.” But, in a true holiday miracle, the band made it their own. Their reinvention naturally feels a bit heavier than the usual chirpy children’s tune: It’s a surreal, slow story-song about a happy, jolly soul running to escape the sun before it melts him away. It’s a sad goodbye, really, under the sheen of smiles and snowflakes. –Liz Pelly\nListen: Cocteau Twins: “Frosty the Snowman”\n“Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”\n35\nFrank Sinatra recorded “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” three times in 15 years. For the first, which appears on 1948’s Christmas Songs by Frank Sinatra, Ol’ Blue Eyes covers Judy Garland’s amended version from the 1944 film Meet Me in St. Louis; the actress had found several of the original lyrics too morbid (“Have yourself a merry little Christmas/It may be your last”) and so composer Hugh Martin sweetened up the verses.\nFor Sinatra’s second take, in 1957, it was he who requested that the writers change a few lines; Sinatra asked Martin to tweak the “we’ll have to muddle through somehow” bit. According to Martin, Sinatra said, “The name of my album is A Jolly Christmas. Do you think you could jolly up that line for me?” So it changed to “hang a shining star upon the highest bow.” Sinatra’s third and final spin, polished and perfected from these two prior efforts, appeared in the 1963 anti-war film The Victors, and it’s the iconic one. “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” remains a holiday classic thanks to Sinatra’s gentlest croon yet, and the song’s sentimental, ever-renewable gratitude for family and home. –Quinn Moreland\nListen: Frank Sinatra: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”\n“Purple Snowflakes”\n34\nAbout 30 years after releasing the label compilation A Motown Christmas, which featured nearly the entire star-studded roster of Motown Records in the early ’70s, the imprint issued a second volume featuring more holiday cuts of the era from the Supremes, the Temptations, the Jackson 5, and others. Absent on the first volume, Marvin Gaye appears twice on the sequel with his cover of “The Christmas Song” and an original called “Purple Snowflakes.” The latter, his standout, is as much about holiday remembrances as it is about ice crystals.\n“Purple Snowflakes” is as unique and striking as its subjects; in its subtle soul energy and delicate arrangements, it mimics a quiet winter evening, a scene where flurries descend softly into a frozen world. Gaye charts their paths slowly from the heavens into a blanket of white; he’s impressed by their intricate designs, as well as his company. “I’m sure that snowflakes fall from the gloom,” he sings. “I will always remember this night/ Here with you.” There’s something truly enchanting about his voice in that moment, this snow globe of his memory unfolding. –Sheldon Pearce\nListen: Marvin Gaye: “Purple Snowflakes”\n“Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”\n33\nChan Marshall didn’t need images of hugging families and snowy suburban festivities to make this track a tearjerker; however, when this cover soundtracked them in a 2013 Apple ad, it worked quite well. Marshall’s husky vocals are unhurried and unadorned, her thoughtful drawl detailing intimacies while conveying empathy for those shuddering outside them; the spare piano and lone violin beneath highlight each striking cadence. In a standard usually stuffed with wide orchestrations and grand choruses, Marshall takes the contrarian path, paring so deeply to the base melody that it becomes fresh again, and a hair-trigger to tears. Almost six years after Marshall released Jukebox—her polished collection of soul, country, and blues covers—her effortless spin through “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” suggested what a holiday album from her might entail: beauty, reflection, and true, thawed-out soul. –Stacey Anderson\nListen: Cat Power: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”\n“Santa Claus Go Straight to the Ghetto”\n32\nJames Brown crossed over from the Godfather of Soul to Godfather Christmas several times, releasing three complete seasonal albums. He wasn’t always a master of staying on-message; the funkiest of those tracks, “Go Power at Christmas Time,” ends up being less about general cheer and more a hilariously random combination of shout-outs to Bobby Byrd and advertisements for his appearance in the Ski Party movie. But Brown sticks with the holiday plot, gloriously, on this 1968 plea for Santa to make his first stop at the projects. There are still call-outs—“Tell him Hank Ballard told you so!”—but sympathy runs deep: “You know that I know what you will see/’Cause that was once me,” the black-and-proud icon tells the red-and-proud benefactor, before co-writer/sax man Pee Wee Ellis wraps it up in a bow and a “Jingle Bells” riff. Brown played Santa’s helper in real life that year, giving out 3,000 gift certificates for Christmas meals to the needy in New York, according to a Jet magazine report. Sometimes you’ve got to step in yourself to “hit it!” when you’re not sure Saint Nick will. –Chris Willman\nListen: James Brown: “Santa Claus Go Straight to the Ghetto”\n“Fairytale of New York”\n31\nThis isn’t just a duet; it’s a full off-Broadway musical, really, in four-and-a-half minutes. Baby, it’s cold inside the drunk tank from which Shane MacGowan shares his Christmas memories of slightly better times, when he still had a woman around to call him a “cheap lousy f****t” (among the other lines that vex would-be cover artists). Recording it proved tricky: the intended female lead, the Pogues’ own Cait O’Riordan, had just left the band, and her proposed replacement Chrissie Hynde had not yet been drafted. Producer Steve Lillywhite found the perfect sparring partner right under his nose: his wife, the late Kirsty MacColl, a UK star in her own right. She adds the proper notes of combative wistfulness in the flashback scenes, helping play them for laughs, but also gets chillingly sober when she retorts to MacGowan’s Brando-esque “I could have been someone” with a cold splash of water: “Well, so could anyone.”\nWhat does all this have to do with Christmas? The universality of alcohol and memories, mainly—and a bunch of NYPD officers who form a choir to serenade their captive. No wonder this UK hit has charted there every December since its release, and found a pretty good following in the land of its inspiration, too. –Chris Willman\nListen: The Pogues ft. Kirsty MacColl: “Fairytale of New York”\n“Little Drummer Boy”\n30\nIn 1999, Low were at the peak of their powers as a slowcore unit, having mastered the art of minimal music that hits with maximal force. They’d already released a few stray Christmas singles, but as the millennium came to a close, they honored the season with a proper record, an eight-song EP that has since become a holiday classic. There are no weak moments on the release, and some of the best songs are Low’s originals—including “Just Like Christmas,” possibly their catchiest and most upbeat tune.\nFor all the record’s spare beauty, though, their aching version of “Little Drummer Boy” is the one for the ages; it’s built around a drone and overlaid with a fine mist of reverb and processing that evokes both snowfall and shoegaze, soft as snow but warm inside. Its arresting beauty didn’t go unnoticed by advertisers (an appearance in a Gap spot popularized it beyond the indie set), but commercial association has not dimmed its heart-expanding force. –Mark Richardson\nListen: Low: “Little Drummer Boy”\n“Marshmallow World”\n29\nSomewhere between the sun shining “red like a pumpkin head” and the “marshmallow clouds being friendly,” winter scenery takes a Dadaist turn on “Marshmallow World,” Carl Sigman and Peter de Rose’s placid 1949 standard that has seen many singers. (Dean Martin recorded a particularly bleary take in 1966, sounding far more invested in the ice inside his highball.) Darlene Love’s version is the snow that sticks; her cover is a gleeful, snappily paced tour through a holiday fantasia, a pastoral scene of gleaming snowmen, rosy cheeks, and mitten-clad hands clasped together during aimless strolls.\nPhil Spector’s Wall of Sound production is at its most formidable here, dexterously stacking saxophones and girl-group harmonies under Love’s divine, full-bodied vocals. She delivers even the more syrupy lines (“It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts/Take a walk with your favorite girl”) with unapologetic brass. It's a treat. –Stacey Anderson\nListen: Darlene Love: “Marshmallow World”\n“Christmas Rappin‘’\n28\nMajor label executives were slow to recognize rap’s sales potential. So in 1979, with test pressings of Kurtis Blow’s “Christmas Rappin’” in hand, the promoter and producer Russell Simmons came up with a fresh strategy: Once early copies had won over area DJs, Simmons encouraged the community to place “fake orders” for the single. “PolyGram didn’t own it yet, but we created an appetite for ‘Christmas Rappin’’ that led them to buy it,” he recalled. The result: a gold record.\nOver a disco-infused beat, Blow interrupts a standard presentation of “‘Twas the Night Before Christmas” to present an image of Santa Claus as a b-boy: “‘But can you stop for a drop before you go?’/He said, ‘Why not if the music's hot?/And I'll chance a dance beneath the mistletoe.’” The surprised partygoers in Santa’s vicinity all get presents, but the Harlem MC also makes a communitarian pitch: “Cause money could never ever buy the feeling/The one that comes from not concealing/The way you you feel about your friends.” The track’s importance in hip-hop’s earliest commercial days is reflected by Public Enemy’s sampling of the track, but “Christmas Rappin’” also stands up on its own as a genuine work in tune with the holiday spirit. –Seth Colter Walls\nListen: Kurtis Blow: “Christmas Rappin’”\n“Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy”\n27\nIn the late 1960s, while David Bowie was an unsuccessful jobbing actor, many of his familiars made the leap to primetime television—including his onetime fling, Lulu, and his idol, Scott Walker. So when Bowie emerged from the cocaine hell of his Thin White Duke period and sought to normalize his career around 1977, it wasn’t too surprising to see the avowed light entertainment enthusiast appear on a Christmas TV special—the pop star’s equivalent of volunteering at an old folks’ home to atone for past sins. But only Bowie had the star power to align himself with America’s premier holiday statesman, Bing Crosby.\nAlthough Bowie was not dreaming of a white Christmas that year, he still balked at the Crosby show producers’ tepid initial pitch that he sing “Little Drummer Boy.” Within an hour, they came up with the “Peace on Earth” interpolation, in which Bowie swoons traditional Christian messages (“Every child must be made to care/Care enough for his fellow man”) over Crosby’s reedy “pa-rum-pa-pump-pum”s. The result is a gigantic Christmas ham preserved in a brine of surreality, the brief flare of the 20th century’s first great multimedia star aligning with its last. (It’s no baton-exchange, though: Hark at Bowie’s other turn on the show, when he performs ““Heroes”” solo, caressing his skinny jumpsuited body while squeezing his very defined buns.) Five weeks later, Crosby died, and Bowie continued his march towards the mainstream. –Laura Snapes\nListen: David Bowie/Bing Crosby: “Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy”\n“Please Come Home for Christmas”\n26\nHaving Bon Jovi, the Eagles, and Kelly Clarkson cover your tune is good for the wallet. Also having Willie Nelson, B.B. King, Fats Domino, and James Brown tackle it means that you’re onto something universal—namely, that the holidays really suck sometimes. The Texas piano man Charles Brown exploded onto the national blues scene in the mid-’40s with his easygoing style; after a string of somber hits, Brown’s luck dried up until “Please Come Home for Christmas,” a final stab at the spotlight that paid dividends.\nHere, Brown gives us a blue Christmas as smooth and strong as spiked eggnog; starting with a trio of bell peals, Brown delivers beautifully aching verses (“Choirs will be singing ‘Silent Night’/Christmas carols by candlelight”) over bouncy, sock-hop piano. And his pleas are reasonable, really: Maybe his baby won’t make it home for the tree, but could she please try for the New Year? With its gorgeous, rolling guitar at the close, and the bells popping up intermittently to boost spirits, “Please Come Home for Christmas” makes an irrefutable case. –Jason Gross\nListen: Charles Brown: “Please Come Home for Christmas”\n“Father Christmas”\n25\nThe Kinks unleashed “Father Christmas” in 1977, right in the middle of the punk revolution. Ray Davies wasn’t really a punk sympathizer—the single’s flip, “Prince of the Punks,” is a broadside against Tom Robinson, the punk rocker who reportedly offended the Kinks leader once in a club—but this holiday track is as insurrectionist as seasonal songs get, a rallying call for all the poor kids who get nothing at Christmas. Davies’ narrator isn’t part of the pack that mugs a department store Santa Claus, demanding money instead of silly toys; he is Santa Claus, a guy who opens the song by admitting, “When I was small I believed in Santa Claus/Though I knew it was my dad.” Such glad tidings are erased once he’s swarmed by a gang that doesn’t want presents, just the means to survive.\nDavies’ sympathies clearly lie with these louts as he pleads, in the bridge, “Remember the kids who got nothin’/While you’re drinking down your wine.” His stance also pulses through the music itself: “Father Christmas” may open with bells that twinkle as brightly as newly fallen snow, but it soon descends into nasty, furious, frustrated rock’n’roll. Together, it becomes the rarest of things: a Christmas song that’s also a protest anthem. –Stephen Thomas Erlewine\nListen: The Kinks: “Father Christmas”\n“Santa Claus Is Coming to Town”\n24\nSince it debuted on Eddie Cantor’s radio show in 1934, “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” has been covered by everybody from Perry Como to Kylie Minogue. It’s a testament to the Jackson 5’s funkiness and the precocious charisma of Michael Jackson that their Motown version is still a gold standard for anybody born after 1960. (If you need another testament, consider that the family band scored a hit with their version in 1970, a year in which they had already released two wildly popular albums.) Both elements of their musicality are equally important: The Jackson brothers freshen the song with a sophisticated funk arrangement that stands up to giants of the era like Sly & the Family Stone, giving it life without ever crossing in dated or gimmicky showmanship. Still, it’s the sheer youthful joy of 12-year-old MJ’s irrepressible vocals that’s made this a true classic and a guaranteed cure for seasonal blues. –Edwin “STATS” Houghton\nListen: Jackson 5: “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town”\n“Merry Christmas Baby”\n23\n“Merry Christmas Baby” was first written and performed by Johnny Moore’s Three Blazers in 1947, lined with twinkling piano and bluesy guitar chords. A slow-burning R&B ballad, the song places its subject at the center of a cozy, loving Christmas morning, surrounded by gifts and standing beneath the mistletoe. It has been covered countless times since, by Chuck Berry, Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Presley, Etta James, and even Hanson.\nBut no artist has re-imagined its melodies or its spirit quite like Otis Redding, who changed the key and kicked up the tempo, turning “Merry Christmas Baby” into a jaunty, sleigh bell-accented ditty while maintaining the blues at its core. Redding’s rendition of the song has an entirely different tone than its predecessors, one that is much more lively and gleeful. It’s more in keeping with the lyrics, which are filled with reverence: “Everything here is beautiful,” he sings. As trumpets blow triumphantly at his back, his husky timbre strikes a precise balance between inspired and gloriously overwhelmed; it just feels merry, and then some. –Sheldon Pearce\nListen: Otis Redding: “Merry Christmas Baby”\n“Jesus Christ”\n22\nIt’s easy to miss the subdued yuletide cheer of Alex Chilton’s “Jesus Christ”—it’s nestled between vulnerable and hook-filled proto-indie tracks on Big Star’s Third/Sister Lovers. Written in part as a reply to former Big Star member Chris Bell’s born-again Christianity, the song doesn’t take its name in vain; it treats its subject with the same laid-back Memphis reverence and somber devotion as the cover of the Velvet Underground’s “Femme Fatale” that followed it on the original 1978 release, a few years after the band disintegrated. With sleigh bells entering ambiently during the first chorus, echoing kettle drums, and a sax solo taking it home, the song is one experiment in an album full of them, providing a genetic connection to Phil Spector’s big beat holiday productions and Chilton’s own fast-receding pop past. –Jesse Jarnow\nListen: Big Star: “Jesus Christ”\n“December Will Be Magic Again”\n21\nAt first gasp, “December Will Be Magic Again” feels like a puff of pure sentimentality, as Kate Bush ticks off a list of festive tropes that pretty much only ever existed on greetings cards. “Take a husky to the ice/While Bing Crosby sings ‘White Christmas’/He makes you feel niiiiiiice,” she trills, as kindly as a grandparent sending a kid off with a pound in their pocket. Bush first performed “December” while perched atop a red-and-gold throne on a 1979 BBC TV Christmas special, and then at the piano on her own broadcast, “Kate,” soon after. Back then, it probably felt like traditional pageantry nestled among the wilder parts of her burgeoning catalog—which it was, when you compare its lilting piano to the synth experimentalism of the next year’s Never for Ever.\nBut there’s more going on here than standard Hallmark cheer. It’s a reassurance: “December will be magic again.” Bush recorded “December” when she was 21 years old, roughly the age when it starts becoming impossible to summon the childlike wonder that Christmas once commanded. It was released in November 1980; since breaking out two years earlier with “Wuthering Heights,” Bush’s life had changed beyond recognition. There’s a measure of anxiety and anticipation in the skittish piano arrangement, which flits between major and minor chords, and in her luxuriant, clipped phrasing. She turns into a snowflake, beholding the white city from the sky, and marvels, “Oh see how I fall” with certainty, as if testing the weight of her footing. Still, despite Bush’s usual bravura vocals, “December” feels low-key compared to her previous singles, so it’s not a surprise that it only peaked at No. 29 in the UK. One of the explanations for its commercial failure: John Lennon was murdered three weeks after its release, though this song of sweetly cautious optimism could’ve lent itself well to those times. –Laura Snapes\nListen: Kate Bush: “December Will Be Magic Again”\n“Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)”\n20\nThose who reject the idea of Christmas don’t ask for much, which explains why this weird, late Ramones anthem resonates, even years later. “Merry Christmas (I Don’t Want to Fight Tonight)”—originally released as a B-side to the “I Wanna Live” single, a decade after Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Tommy began recording—is one of the best and brightest punk holiday classics, a scrappy, two-minute rock blast marked by Joey Ramone’s defeated, warbling tenor. “Where is Santa? At his sleigh?/Tell me why is it always this way?” Joey laments. “Christmas ain't the time for breaking each other's heart.” A slower, slicker version later appeared on Joey’s 2002 solo EP Christmas Spirit… In My House alongside a cover of “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),” as well as on his 2012 album Ya Know? Both were released posthumously, and prove his holiday angst can still hit hard. –Liz Pelly\nListen: Ramones: “Merry Christmas (I Don't Want to Fight Tonight)”\n“Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree”\n19\nAfter witnessing the huge success of “Jingle Bell Rock” in 1957, Johnny Marks—the composer behind “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” and “A Holly Jolly Christmas”—became determined to create his own teenybopper Yuletide hit. He found its singer in Brenda Lee, then just 13 years old; her pipes on “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” are confident beyond her years, sliding smoothly from a slinky shimmy to an all-out belt as she celebrates the holidays “in a new old-fashioned way.”\nThe 1958 sessions for “Rockin’” occurred in Nashville in July, with the air conditioning blasting and a Christmas tree set up for atmosphere. Backing Lee were Boots Randolph on sax, studio wizard Hank Garland on guitar, and the Anita Kerr Singers crooning harmonies. But even with its all-star creative crew, “Rockin’” was, by all accounts, a flop: It sold fewer than 5,000 copies worldwide the year of its release and sat largely forgotten until 1960, when it hit No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts (thanks to Lee’s growing teen idol popularity). “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” was a fun and necessary bridge between traditional Christmas music and its rock future, less concerned with roasting chestnuts than drinking eggnog and boogying all night. –Quinn Moreland\nListen: Brenda Lee: “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree”\n“Santa Baby”\n18\nIt’s not exactly progressive to solicit Santa in a coy, babyish purr, bartering ostensibly good behavior for furs, rings, and a full-on “platinum mine.” (Plus, what is the long game on the latter—are you going to extract it yourself, girl? In the furs?) Still, Eartha Kitt is owed her due for one of the most entertaining Christmas standards of the 1950s, a tongue-in-cheek caricature of the holidays’ glittery consumptions that frolics between camp and sultriness. Kitt’s high lilt is awfully close to infantilized, but her smirking is audible in the bawdy euphemisms (“Come and trim my Christmas tree/With some decorations bought at Tiffany’s”). The low, opining ba-bumps of the male choir conjure images of rows of deferential suitors in dinner jackets, prostrating themselves at the divine Miss Kitt’s feet as she floats by haughtily. If she didn’t get her gift of glorious manipulation from Santa, she certainly sourced it from some other supernatural power. –Stacey Anderson\nListen: Eartha Kitt: “Santa Baby”\n“Sleigh Ride”\n17\nPhil Spector gave Darlene Love plenty of quality songs to wail when he created the greatest holiday pop album of all time, 1963’s A Christmas Gift for You. But he didn’t forget to leave a few presents for Veronica Bennett, soon to be known as Ronnie Spector. “Sleigh Ride” is three minutes of the greatest glee to be found the annals of holiday music—or winter music, technically, since Leroy Anderson and Mitchell Parish’s chestnut never actually makes explicit mention of Christmas. The song gets its own halting, symphonic overture, essentially, complete with sleighing and neighing sound effects, before the Wall of Saxes kicks in and history’s most celebrated girl-group repeatedly sings the line that Parish forgot to include: “Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding.” Bundled up or not, this innocent romp through the woods becomes rapturous before returning to an equally halting come-down of an ending—one in which the Wrecking Crew, seemingly a hundred violinists, a sleigh driver, Ronnie Spector, and you all crash, exhausted, into the snowbank of dreams. –Chris Willman\nListen: The Ronettes: “Sleigh Ride”\n“Christmas in Hollis”\n16\nRun-D.M.C. didn’t want to make a Christmas song. They thought it would be corny, fake—a way for corporate America to sanitize hip-hop, to dismiss the genre as mere novelty just as the trio was helping turn it into a widespread commercial and cultural force. Plus, there already was a holiday rap staple—Kurtis Blow’s 1979 trifle “Christmas Rappin’,” also the first-ever hip-hop song released on a major label—and they didn’t want to be seen as piggybackers.\nBut then Jam Master Jay got ahold of the horny fanfare from a 1968 song called “Back Door Santa,” and a modern Christmas classic was born. The sampled track by Clarence Carter is about an especially randy Saint Nick (“I make all the little girls happy/While the boys are out to play,” the soul man crows, somewhat creepily), and its rawness makes “Christmas in Hollis” feel like a worthy addition to Run-D.M.C.’s harder-than-steel minimalism instead of a crass capitulation. With rhymes about returning Santa’s lost wallet and digging into Mom’s collard greens at the dinner table, the song is humble, unpretentious. It invites you in from the Queens cold. The equally legendary video reinforces this new kind of wintertime fable, giving life to a world where pit bulls wear antlers and dookie chains can be found under every tree. —Ryan Dombal\nListen: Run-D.M.C.: “Christmas in Hollis”\n“I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday”\n15\nThe look was pure glam-rock; the sonics, pure Phil Spector. Many have tried to recreate the Wall of Sound heard on his compilation A Christmas Gift for You, and nearly all have fallen flat. Yet Roy Wood, who in 1973 had just ditched the cellos of the Electric Light Orchestra, turned out to have a sure touch with multi-tracked saxes in this one-off homage to Spector.\nIn the history of Anglo/American inequities, there are few imbalances as unjust as the fact that “I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday” is ubiquitous in the UK and an eternal non-starter in the U.S. Even in England, it never surpassed No. 4, yet it returned to the charts in the ’80s and again in the 2000s and 2010s. It also gets covered often by pop divas like Kylie Minogue, and almost always awfully, since the tune turns deeply cloying when you lose Wood’s Phil-harmonic homages yet keep the climactic children’s choir. Still, the sights in the original video—featuring a bunch of scarily face-painted, prog-rock glamsters pulling off such a bubblegum track—is as eternal a Christmas gift as Spector’s own mother lode. –Chris Willman\nListen: Wizzard: “I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday”\n“Last Christmas”\n14\nIn the 1980s, Wham! ascended to British pop’s highest echelons on a cloud made of hot air, hairspray, and naked ambition. As the miner’s strike raged and unemployment figures broke national records, George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley represented the smooth shamelessness of Thatcherite capitalism, which caused NME critic Ian Penman to declare them “more offensive than Jerry Lee Lewis, a suspected mass murderer.” Lambasting their lack of tone and gravity, he also accused them of “collaborating on 1984 as our Year of the Fake Tan.”\nIt’s both a fair comment and the perfect conditions to create a festive single that crystallizes the season’s guzzling sentimentality. Written in the time it took Ridgeley to watch an episode of “Match of the Day,” “Last Christmas” is as aggressively synthetic as a gust of polystyrene snow on an air-conditioned breeze. It’s a relentless, four-and-a-half minute burst of kitschy synths that ascend and then twinkle back down again like Escher escalators, looping nightmarishly between department store floors on Christmas Eve.\nMichael’s lament for a careless gifter is feeble, but it’s also perfect: hurt and hopeful, matching his Lady Di bouffant with her doe-eyed coyness. “Once bitten and twice shy/ I keep my distance but you still catch my eye” is one of pop’s all-time great lines, a proto-Swiftian slice of wounded concision (obviously, she covered it in 2007). A 32-year mainstay of the season, “Last Christmas” has more than earned its nostalgia, though it has a renewed resonance these days. As British advertisers unleash earnest, big-budget Christmas commercials in an attempt to reframe shopping as an act of love, Wham!’s shameless pitch for gold feels like Old Testament honesty. –Laura Snapes\nListen: Wham!: “Last Christmas”\n“Another Lonely Christmas”\n13\nChristmas is the loneliest time of year for many, but nobody wallowed in seasonal despair as beautifully as Prince. “Another Lonely Christmas” first appeared as the B-side of the single of “I Would Die 4 U” in November 1984, just after Purple Rain turned Prince into a supernova, but the compelling thing about the song is that it doesn't sound like the work of a superstar. It's the sound of a man wallowing in his own grief, living in a room so cavernous that every instrument echoes off the walls.\nSadness may lurk at the heart of “Another Lonely Christmas”—it finds a man mourning the death of his beloved, where the memories intertwine with the present so he can never move forward—but it's mitigated by Prince's eccentricity. Nothing in “Another Lonely Christmas” follows a familiar path: He remembers how his lover screamed because she hated the number nine, and now that she's gone, he drinks banana daiquiris until he's blind. Such details aren't precisely personal—this isn't confession, it's theater—but they're odd enough to give “Another Lonely Christmas” resonance. Maybe the story Prince is telling never happened, but as he pounds his piano and testifies, it certainly feels like it did. And as he wails, he creates an anthem for everybody who has ever spent Christmas alone, haunted by how things used to be. –Stephen Thomas Erlewine\nListen: Prince: “Another Lonely Christmas”\n“Christmas Wrapping”\n12\nBack in 1981, the Waitresses’ Chris Butler wrote the real fairytale of New York. Overwhelmed by a hectic year and excessive festive social pressures, the female protagonist of “Christmas Wrapping” (embodied brilliantly by Patty Donahue) decides not to bother with the holiday, and in doing so gives herself the season’s must-have gift: “I just need to catch my breath/Christmas by myself this year.” For a song written by avowed humbug Butler under duress from ZE Records, “Christmas Wrapping” should be maudlin and obtuse. But thanks to his rare gift for crafting nuanced, modern female voices, Donahue’s role isn’t pitiful but self-possessed: She’s wry, honest, ambivalent but not cynical, and unwilling to supplant a taxing work schedule with an equally taxing party schedule. (Here, “the world’s smallest turkey” isn’t a stand-in for the world’s smallest violin.)\nWith its Kurtis Blow-meets-new wave vibe, “Christmas Wrapping” is New York to the core. Butler turns the street-corner brass band into squalling funk fanfare, and mirrors the city’s incessant sparkle with the Waitresses’ waterfall of percussion, which skews grimier than your average sleigh bell. Ultimately, Butler lets a little festive magic seep in by giving Donahue a happy ending. Her ship-in-the-night crush finally comes into port when she nips out for condiments on Christmas Day, leading to the kind of meet-cute that would define Nora Ephron’s big-city love letters a few years later: “You mean, you forgot cranberries, too?!” –Laura Snapes\nListen: The Waitresses: “Christmas Wrapping”\n“Santa Claus Is Coming to Town”\n11\nBruce Springsteen’s best-known Christmas tune was captured live at the end of a pivotal year. It was recorded during the tail-end of a set in front of 3,000 people at C.W. Post College in Long Island on December 12, 1975, four months after the release of Born to Run and one month after the show that became Hammersmith Odeon London ’75. Even then, his status as a legendary live performer was secure, and spontaneity is key to what makes his version of “Santa Claus...” so memorable.\nSpringsteen went to school on Phil Spector records while cutting Born to Run, hoping to capture some of the master’s symphonic drama, and somewhere along the way, he absorbed Spector’s A Christmas Gift for You. His arrangement of the song is loosely based on the Crystals’ take from LP and, complete with sleigh bells and glockenspiel, it suitably evokes the season. But the power of this take is in how it captures the feeling of friends goofing around onstage, from Springsteen’s opening ad-libs about the band being good and practicing to the vocal flubs to Clarence Clemons’ closing “ho-ho-ho”s. The Big Man’s enthusiasm with his Santa impression renders Springsteen breathless—he literally can’t sing because he’s laughing so hard, and the general good cheer of it all is utterly infectious. –Mark Richardson\nListen: Bruce Springsteen: “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town”\n“This Christmas”\n10\nOne of the best Christmas song traditions is being single-mindedly devoted to sex. The mistletoe, the eggnog, the holiday parties—from “All I Want for Christmas Is You” winsome all the way to “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” creepy, there is a long and glorious tradition of singers using the holidays as nothing more than a bald-faced excuse to strip off their Christmas sweaters. Donny Hathaway’s sly, swinging soul burner “This Christmas” is one such song, as under those sleigh bells there is more going on than innocent tree decorating: “We’re caroling through the night,” he sings. “This Christmas will be a very special Christmas for me.” It’s a hope, a wish, and a pick-up line all at once. –Jayson Greene\nListen: Donny Hathaway: “This Christmas”\n“Blue Christmas”\n9\n“Blue Christmas” was first recorded by Doye O'Dell in 1948, when Elvis Presley was 13. O’Dell played it as a straight country song, providing a blueprint for Ernest Tubb, who took the song to number one a year later. Only historians remember these versions, though, because Elvis Presley claimed it for good on his 1957 LP, Elvis’ Christmas Album.\nPresley was the first singer to treat “Blue Christmas” as a blues jam, leaning into its simple changes and letting his backing singers, the Jordanaires, function as a choir, wailing away on the chorus. Whether on his first rendition or the live version from his 1968 comeback album, there's a swing to his rhythm, complemented by how Presley plays with the melody. Where O'Dell and Tubb treated the song as a sacred text, Presley pours himself into its pathos while also delivering something sexy and new. He may be on his own this Christmas, but his performance suggests that it’s his absent lover who’s really missing out. –Stephen Thomas Erlewine\nListen: Elvis Presley: “Blue Christmas”\n“Little Saint Nick”\n8\nIn the summer of 1963, Brian Wilson played piano in sessions for A Christmas Gift for You From Phil Spector; his parts didn’t make the final cut, but the experience encouraged him to write a holiday tune for the Beach Boys. It became “Little Saint Nick,” a peppy jingle reminiscent in both structure and content to “Little Deuce Coupe,” the B-side released a few months prior. As co-written by Wilson and Mike Love, “Little Saint Nick” stands in for one of the Beach Boys’ preferred topics, a hot rod; it’s a candy-apple red sled that Santa whips through the snow.\n“Little Saint Nick” offers a humorous, hip take on Kris Kringle, and it peaked at No. 3 on Billboard’s Christmas Chart, and its success encouraged the Beach Boys to record an entire holiday record the next year, The Beach Boys’ Christmas Album. “Little Saint Nick” received an update for the occasion, and its glockenspiel, celesta, and sleigh bells were removed. But in both versions, Love’s cheery vocals and Wilson’s bright falsetto of “Merry Christmas, Saint Nick” make Santa seem like one of the guys, even if the North Pole is a bit far from their shores. –Quinn Moreland\nListen: The Beach Boys: “Little Saint Nick”\n“Happy Xmas (War Is Over)”\n7\nPart Phil Spector-produced holiday spectacular, part conceptual political slogan, part classic John Lennon melody, “Happy Xmas (War Is Over)” was the ex-Beatle’s last non-album single and a classic in his and Yoko Ono’s discography of pioneering message-pop. A cap on a series of collaborations that combined Ono’s instructional art pieces with Lennon’s rock résumé (“Imagine,” “Give Peace a Chance”), “Happy Xmas (War Is Over)” built on the tagline they’d used on a series of “War Is Over (If You Want)” billboards in 1969, and created something more enduring than any of the Beatles’ holiday efforts.\nWith the Harlem Community Choir delivering the ineffable counter-refrain, and Ono’s voice settled inside a Wall of Sound-approved lushness, the song’s radical bona fides might not be audible at first pass. “Put your political message across with a little honey” was how Lennon described the strategy; in doing so, he and Ono elevated a surrealist pop novelty to the realm of Christmas standard. –Jesse Jarnow\nListen: John Lennon/The Plastic Ono Band/The Harlem Community Choir: “Happy Xmas (War Is Over)”\n“River”\n6\nWho said holiday songs have to be happy? This composition from Joni Mitchell’s Blue is one of the most exquisite weepers ever to reference the Christmas season. In the piano introduction, Mitchell’s right hand rings out a melancholic adaptation of “Jingle Bells.” During the first verse, the narrator looks on sadly as reindeer displays are mounted. Where she comes from, winter brings rivers for skating—though in her present location, “it stays pretty green.” Her yearning for home, and more, is plain to hear; the pain only intensifies as she sings, in her highest register: “I wish I had a river so long/I would teach my feet to fly/I wish I had a river/I could skate away on.”\nWhat a first-time listener doesn’t know just yet is that Mitchell’s narrator blames herself for this emotional devastation. After stepping down from that vocal high ledge, the same interval that Mitchell used for her “Jingle Bells” reharmonization appears once more in the piano part, a miserable full-circle that precedes her admission, “I made my baby cry.” And so the urge to get with society’s scheduled mirth crashes directly into her private agony. Anyone desiring an escape from their own inconveniently timed alienation can find solace in this wise and gorgeous song. –Seth Colter Walls\nListen: Joni Mitchell: “River”\n“My Favorite Things”\n5\n“My Favorite Things” first appeared in Rodgers and Hammerstein’s 1959 musical The Sound of Music, and its status as a holiday song was solidified when Julie Andrews sang it in a 1961 TV Christmas special. In the year prior, John Coltrane recorded a version on soprano saxophone, his first time using the instrument in the studio; it would become his signature tune for the last six years of his life, the standard feature of his concert repertoire.\nLive, Coltrane twisted “My Favorite Things” into all kinds of different shapes, eventually dispensing with tonality entirely in hour-long versions (check Live in Japan). But the studio version of the song has an understated, welcome tunefulness, and was accessible enough to be released in an edited version as a 7” single. McCoy Tyner’s delicate piano zeroes in on the see-sawing chords of the composition, creating a space for exploration but also a comforting tone that echoes the piece’s original setting as a song sung to children. And Coltrane’s careful but adventurous treatment of the melody, especially when the key jumps after the initial statement of the tune, is unfailingly gorgeous, the entire concept of peace on Earth rendered into sound. –Mark Richardson\nListen: John Coltrane: “My Favorite Things”\n“Run Rudolph Run”\n4\nMelodically near-identical to “Little Queenie,” Berry’s hit the following year, “Run Rudolph Run” is a zippy, kindly singalong that captures the enthusiasm of the holidays without any saccharinity. Its fond nod to “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” is not coincidental—Berry’s hit was cowritten by Johnny Marks, who also penned the original standard—and it was the first successful rhythm-and-blues spin on staid holiday fare.\n“Run Rudolph Run”’s lean cheer has proven adaptable; it’s been covered by a stable of machismo-heavy rockers—Lynyrd Skynyrd, Keith Richards, Lemmy Kilmister with Billy Gibbons and Dave Grohl—as well as soundtracked such kid-friendly fare as Home Alone and Jingle All the Way. Berry’s yelps of “Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town/Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down/Run, run Rudolph 'cause I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round” are still delirious, decades on. *–*Stacey Anderson\nListen: Chuck Berry: “Run Rudolph Run”\n“All I Want for Christmas Is You”\n3\nFew artists who've come to prominence since the 1990s have the range to come up with a new Christmas standard. Meaningful covers of holiday classics? That’s easier. But to make something that lasts more than a few seasons takes confidence, a genuine embrace of the Christmas spirit, lyrical universality, and the kind of self-regard that can stare cheesiness in the face and say, “I don’t know her.” Which is how Mariah Carey, Patron Saint of Having the Range, pulled it off two decades ago.\nCarey co-wrote “All I Want for Christmas Is You” with longtime collaborator Walter Afanasieff for her first holiday album, Merry Christmas. The track is deliriously uptempo, putting Carey’s powerhouse vocals front-and-center. The vibrato is pure ’90s pop-R&B, but it’s the song’s wink toward Motown—the Ronettes-style backup singers, in particular—that makes it timeless, and helped it become one of the best-selling singles of all time, in any genre. Even its grating inclusion in Love Actually couldn’t topple its holiday supremacy. And though that track has been played ad nauseum from Halloween to New Year for so many years, “All I Want for Christmas Is You” still enjoys the distinction of being one of the few modern holiday songs that won’t actually make you nauseous. –Cady Drell\nListen: Mariah Carey: “All I Want for Christmas Is You”\n“Christmastime Is Here”\n2\nMost classic Christmas music dates back to WWII, when the human race seemed doomed for extinction. This is why the most enduring holiday songs come with a cold tendril of dread curling around them—that “I’ll be home for Christmas, but only in my dreams” foreboding, meant to make soldiers stationed abroad weep onto their stationery.\nVince Guaraldi’s “Christmastime Is Here” sounds like crippling depression set amongst cheer, which is why it stands tall in this haunted canon. Whatever your religion or creed, everyone in America walks among the Christmas industrial complex—the gleaming phalanx of stars, tinsel, and boughs of holly dangling from every retail surface and beaming out of every shop window. There is no holiday sentiment more universal than suspecting you should feel more cheerful than you do, fearing that others are huddled in warmth while you stand in the cold. That’s what this children’s choir sighing “snowflakes in the air” tells us, deep in our bones.\n“Christmastime Is Here” began its life as a soundtrack to A Charlie Brown Christmas, another piece of art that snuck existential dread into our holiday pablum. But that leisurely, blue note-inflected line has transcended its association with the Peanuts gang and become a stand-in for the holiday season’s familiar, reassuring melancholy. We smile while ignoring the tug of loneliness, the pain that reminds us tomorrow won’t be Christmas anymore. Oh, that we could always see such spirit through the year. –Jayson Greene\nListen: Vince Guaraldi Trio: “Christmastime Is Here”\n“Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)”\n1\nHolidays are often best experienced in hindsight. Looking back, the snow is pristine (instead of just cold), the family is endearing (instead of just combative), and the turkey is juicy and flavorful (instead of just overcooked and bland). These gilded memories are comforting, but they usually can’t help but give way to the sobering reality we feel each December.\nThis dynamic is a driving force behind 1963’s “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),” in which all the happy tokens of the season only serve to remind Darlene Love of what she’s missing. Originally featured as the sole original on the compilation album A Christmas Gift for You From Phil Spector, the song started off as a rock’n’roll anomaly amid hymn-like standards such as “Silent Night” and “White Christmas.” More than a half-century later, the song is iconic; everyone from U2 to Mariah Carey to Death Cab for Cutie has taken it on, though none have bested Spector and Love’s overwhelming first take.\n“Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” was not an instant success, though. It was originally released on November 22, 1963—the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated—and didn’t make much of a splash. But over the years, its stature has grown, spurred on by a re-release of A Christmas Gift for You on the Beatles’ Apple Records in 1972—as well as a nearly 30-year run, from 1986 through 2014, when Love belted out the song annually on David Letterman’s late-night shows. According to lore, Letterman is something of a Scrooge, but he always had a soft spot for “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),” and it’s easy to see why. The song recognizes the sadness of the season, but Love finds a way to rise above through her longing—in her roaring delivery, joy brings sorrow, which brings more joy. Her plea is simple. And, as long as there are Christmases to remember, it will not be forgotten. –Ryan Dombal\nListen: Darlene Love: “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)”\nContributors: Stacey Anderson, Ryan Dombal, Cady Drell, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Jayson Greene, Jason Gross, Edwin “STATS” Houghton, Jesse Jarnow, Quinn Moreland, Sheldon Pearce, Liz Pelly, Mark Richardson, Ryan Schreiber, Laura Snapes, Seth Colter Walls, Chris Willman",

But that’s not all it was. The 1960s also included the slyly political pop of Brazil’s Os Mutantes, the early electronic experiments of Silver Apples, and the free jazz exhalations of Albert Ayler. It was a single-oriented era—a startlingly inventive period following the initial explosion of rock’n’roll but before the album became dominant—when entire new genres seemed to bubble up every few months. The ’60s marked a time when pop music became more than a teenage fad, turning into an important art form in its own right as it soundtracked the civil rights movement, the hippie heyday, and the Vietnam War.\nIn an effort to highlight less iconic artists and properly showcase the variety of sounds the ’60s had to offer, this list features no more than five entries by any given artist. These are the 200 songs that most resonate with a generation too young to have experienced the decade firsthand, but old enough to know it had more to offer than “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction.”\nThe Kinks: “Sunny Afternoon” (1966)\nWhile already rightly revered as bratty garage rockers by the time of this track’s release, the Kinks truly excelled when singer Ray Davies took a more observational, wry approach to songwriting—and “Sunny Afternoon” is one of his wriest on record. As the song’s ground-down, sadsack narrator, Davies sounds utterly exhausted by the task of telling his miserable tale, backed by a descending chromatic bassline that nearly flatlines by song’s end. –Adam Moerder\nListen: The Kinks: “Sunny Afternoon”\nNina Simone: “Black Is the Color of My True Love’s Hair” (1964)\nThe famous Celtic ballad begins with a lustful list of physical attributes—a true love’s hair, face, eyes, and hands—but Nina Simone’s voice is less than interested in the material world. She emits a spectral trill, as confident and crestfallen as a death-row inmate. Even the skeletal piano feels too heavy for Simone’s vaporous devotion. –Alex Linhardt\nListen: Nina Simone: “Black Is the Color of My True Love’s Hair”\nDionne Warwick: “Walk on By” (1964)\nPeople talk about “perfect pop” and I generally have no idea what they’re talking about. “Walk on By” is perfect pop, though, in the strictest sense: not a hair is out of place, no smudged eyeliner, nothing to taint its inherent loveliness. Any Bacharach/Warwick collaboration is a pick hit to click, but this is the most famous for a reason. Poised to the brink of formality, the song moves with the utterly unhurried grace of a woman in a ball gown. Perfect composure is one way to keep the tears inside, after all. –Jess Harvell\nListen: Dionne Warwick: “Walk on By”\nCharles Mingus: “Solo Dancer” (1963)\nThe Black Saint and the Sinner Lady is regularly cited as a masterpiece of jazz orchestration, but that hardly accounts for the sheer fury of Mingus’ creativity. “Solo Dancer” is like a jazz diagram of the psyche or a chronology of the 20th century: a swarming assembly of neon alto, cracked trumpets, chromatic discord, and prolonged lyricism. –Alex Linhardt\nListen: Charles Mingus: “Solo Dancer”\nIrma Thomas: “Time Is on My Side” (1964)\nThough Thomas is widely acknowledged as the Soul Queen of Nola, I’ve always thought she never got a fair shake (e.g. neither “Ruler of My Heart” nor “Don’t Mess With My Man” made this list). The Rolling Stones eventually made this song a smash, but all they did was jack Thomas’ steez in full, changing nary a note, save one small thing: They could never belt like her. –Sean Fennessey\nListen: Irma Thomas: “Time Is on My Side”\nJames Brown: “Night Train (Live at the Apollo)” (1963)\nSure, the official version (released in 1962) moves and grooves just fine, especially with Brown doing double duty on the mic and on the drums. But compared to what’s on Live at the Apollo, it’s doing the standing still. On the greatest stage in the world, Mr. Star Time goes up and down the eastern seaboard in record time, shouting out the stops the train ain’t stopping at, while the band throws more and more coal into the engine. –David Raposa\nListen: James Brown: “Night Train (Live at the Apollo)”\nThe Foundations: “Build Me Up Buttercup” (1968)\nThis is the stuff mixtapes are made of: an infectiously catchy melody that sugarcoats a protagonist’s romantic plight, and lyrics that instantaneously connect with red-blooded love birds. The Foundations’ career may have burned short and hot, but their pop chops and puppy-dog pathos remain timeless. –Adam Moerder\nListen: The Foundations: “Build Me Up Buttercup”\nJohnny and June Carter Cash: “Jackson” (1967)\nAbout a haranguing wife that, in the fourth verse, transforms into a creature far more badass than her “big talkin’” husband, “Jackson” puts to song the time-honored tradition of doing crazy things to fix a crazy relationship. The story is almost as romantic as that of the two lovers who sing it. –Zach Baron\nListen: Johnny and June Carter Cash: “Jackson”\nAlton Ellis: “I’m Still in Love With You” (1967)\nWith Alton Ellis crying eternal affection above a gentle, stuttering riddim, this is the perfect starry-eyed Jamaican wedding song, right? Not quite. \"You don’t know how to love me, not even how to kiss me—I just don’t know why…\" he sneaks in, slyly mixing tragedy in with the love-drunk refrain. Unrequited love has rarely seemed so tantalizing. –Ryan Dombal\nListen: Alton Ellis: “I’m Still in Love With You”\nThe Cannonball Adderley Quintet: “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” (1966)\nIt wasn’t really recorded at “The Club”—that was just a trick to get some publicity for a new venue on Chicago’s South Side. Instead, Adderley got some friends together in the studio and plied them with drinks while the band cut this bit of surging, euphoric gospel. Every whoop, though, is true and from the heart. –Mark Richardson\nListen: The Cannonball Adderley Quintet: “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy”\nLeonard Cohen: “So Long, Marianne” (1968)\n“So Long, Marianne”’s acoustic strum and weepy concertina crank up once Cohen weighs his conflicting desires for shelter and freedom, establishing a recursive loop of lamentation and joy. Love is a filament of web binding him to a ledge—stronger than its fragile appearance would imply; it’s easier stretched than severed. –Brian Howe\nListen: Leonard Cohen: “So Long, Marianne”\nThe Sonics: “Strychnine” (1965)\nA song about drinking rat poison and liking it more than either water or wine. Garage-rock proto-punks the Sonics—without their raw fuzzed-buzz and Gerry Roslie’s roll’n’roll howl—played rock that couldn’t help but shock and awe. –Zach Baron\nListen: The Sonics: “Strychnine”\nTyrannosaurus Rex: “Debora” (1968)\nPre-glam, pre–T. Rex Marc Bolan recorded this hand-drummed Lord of the Rings Brit folk spasmodica. Among other things, it’s another great example of Bolan’s unmistakable influence on Devendra Banhart and the Hairy Fairy crew. The jumpy verbal string of “Dug a re dug n dug a re dug re dug” and lines like “O Debora, always dress like a conjurer/It’s fine to see your young face hiding/’Neath the stallion that I’m riding” confirm why Bolan named his book of poetry a very Danzig-sounding The Warlock of Love. But really, he’s Donovan with chops. –Brandon Stosuy\nListen: Tyrannosaurus Rex: “Debora”\nThe Walker Brothers: “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore” (1966)\nBefore Scott Walker was a shivery avant-gardist, he was a shivery crooner pinup, and this spaghetti Western anthem was his band’s biggest hit. Like the Righteous Brothers by way of the Free Design and Ennio Morricone, this was light years away from his current coordinates, but no less cinematic. –Mark Pytlik\nListen: The Walker Brothers: “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore”\nThe Hollies: “Bus Stop” (1966)\nNever mind that “Bus Stop” evokes a gentler counterculture in which the youth of the nation enacted mating rituals—attraction, pairing, commitment—underneath a pedestrian umbrella. From the first sprinkles of acoustic guitar to the stormcloud minor chords, from the desperate harmonies of the chorus to the sweet idea of falling in love out of the rain, this Hollies hit is all hook. –Stephen M. Deusner\nListen: The Hollies: “Bus Stop”\nThe Temptations: “Get Ready” (1966)\nOn the verses, “Get Ready” is a tense and unforgiving stomper, but the chorus turns the song into a sweeping drama, a transcendent whoop of joy—and throughout it all, Eddie Kendricks’ angelic falsetto floats overhead like a balloon caught in a gust of wind. –Tom Breihan\nListen: The Temptations: “Get Ready”\nJames Brown: “Mother Popcorn (You Got to Have a Mother for Me)” (1969)\nNo words can describe this song’s throbbing physicality better than the singer’s own “Jump back baby, James Brown’s gonna do his thing.” That “thing” involves a hysterical performance that switches from a sexualized grunt to a bizarre, high-pitched whine without warning. And with a horn chart snaking around a squirmy guitar line, Brown’s band does its thing, too. –Stephen M. Deusner\nListen: James Brown: “Mother Popcorn (You Got to Have a Mother for Me)”\nBobby Darin: “Beyond the Sea” (1960)\nThe aural definition of “wistful,” the lyrics to “Beyond the Sea” scan as if there should be doubt that the song’s distant lovers will meet again. In his reading of the song, Darin doesn’t sound so sure; even when his band gets raucous, he sits it out and comes back as melancholy as ever. –Joe Tangari\nListen: Bobby Darin: “Beyond the Sea”\nPatsy Cline: “She’s Got You” (1962)\nMoney can’t buy love, but roving hands can steal it, and on this countrypolitan waltz, Cline sounds irrevocably bereaved, running through possessions she has, and the precious one that no longer belongs to her. I think there’s a piano in my beer. –Marc Hogan\nListen: Patsy Cline: “She’s Got You”\nFrance Gall: “Laisse Tomber les Filles” (1964)\nIn 1964, Gall was a 17-year-old ingénue, but her mentor—a promising 36-year-old lecher named Serge Gainsbourg—turned garish jailbait euphemisms into an art form. Accompanied by swooning trumpets and speakeasy bass, Gall makes her way through a tawdry jukebox-slapping cabaret populated by alcoholics and nymphettes. If pop music is supposed to combine virginity and carnality, “Laisse Tomber les Filles” might well be the pinnacle of yé-yé ecstasy. –Alex Linhardt\nListen: France Gall: “Laisse Tomber les Filles”\nThe Barbarians: “Moulty” (1965)\nThis song is best known for being the inspirational tale of the band’s hook-handed drummer, but I’ll put up the chorus of “Moulty” against any other from the decade—“Louie Louie,” “Mony Mony,” anything—as being the biggest, loudest, and most unintelligible, made all the more dynamically triumphant by the aw-shucks verses. –Rob Mitchum\nListen: The Barbarians: “Moulty”\nBembeya Jazz National: “Armée Guinéenne” (1969)\nUpdating an old folk song honoring warriors and dedicating it to Guinea’s then-fledgling armed forces, Bembeya Jazz created a hypnotic masterpiece. Balafon and percussion underpin Cuban-influenced horns and vocals, but Sekou Diabate’s lead guitar steals the show as the fluid lifeblood of the song. –Joe Tangari\nListen: Bembeya Jazz National: “Armée Guinéenne”\nOtis Redding: “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long (To Stop Now)” (1965)\nFew performer/musician combos have enjoyed better, tighter dynamics than the ones forged between Redding and the Stax house band. The players follow his lead at every note, offsetting his soul-wrenching performance with austere horn ascensions and demonstrative punches. Redding makes the climax massive, but the band downplays it sweetly, internalizing his proclamation and making it an intimate exchange as much between the singer and band as between a man and a woman. –Stephen M. Deusner\nListen: Otis Redding: “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long (To Stop Now)”\nThe Tammys: “Egyptian Shumba” (1963)\nIt’s not just that this girl group’s gone wilder than any garage band on the list—it’s that they’re possessed. The Tammys bop hard and bratty, but by the chorus they’re literally growling, barking, and squealing like sexed-up hyenas; in the bridge you can hear them shudder and jerk their way into a frenzy. It’s their party and they’ll scream if they want to. –Nitsuh Abebe\nListen: The Tammys: “Egyptian Shumba”\nMC5: “Kick Out the Jams” (1969)\nThis one’s a classic before it even starts, thanks to Rob Tyner’s still-startling introduction (take the title, add “muthafuckahhhs!”). Though punk more in intent (“Let me be who I am!”) than action (essentially, post-Who/Jimi Hendrix blooze-rock, but sloppier), this remains an eternal rallying cry for anarchy in the USA. –Stuart Berman\nListen: MC5: “Kick Out the Jams”\nLoretta Lynn: “Don’t Come Home a Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ on Your Mind)” (1967)\nLoretta Lynn hates drunk sex (or something). Loves the Iraq War, though. She said as much at a pre–Jack White Taste of Chicago. But “Liquor and love, they just don’t mix,” teases Lynn on 1967’s “Don’t Come Home a Drinkin’”, with honky-tonk pedal steel and juke-joint piano. See, lady is crazy! –Marc Hogan\nListen: Loretta Lynn: “Don’t Come Home a Drinkin’ (With Lovin’ on Your Mind)”\nDarlene Love: “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” (1963)\nLove’s woe-steeped holiday ballad is the best Xmas present Phil Spector ever gave. The track features all of the producer’s trademarks and his dense arrangement provides the perfect backdrop for Love’s rich voice, making it easy to understand why this has become an integral part of the Christmas music canon. –Cory D. Byrom\nListen: Darlene Love: “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)”\nPhil Ochs: “I Ain’t Marching Anymore” (1965)\nOf all the protest songs Ochs penned, “I Ain’t Marching Anymore” is the strongest. Ochs’ narrow tenor and staccato guitar propel this anthem about a soldier who up and stops killing. It’s an urgent rebuke against the war in Vietnam, but Ochs also takes the high road: He doesn’t rip into the old men who start the wars that get young men killed—he just puts down his gun and walks away. –Chris Dahlen\nListen: Phil Ochs: “I Ain’t Marching Anymore”\nArchie Bell & the Drells: “Here I Go Again” (1969)\nWhether it be “Tighten Up,” “I Can’t Stop Dancing,” “Dancing to Your Music,” “Dance Your Troubles Away,” or “Dancin’ Man,” these dudes sure liked to dance. But with this Gamble & Huff swift-string strut, Bell and Co. took on a different kind of hustle. “I should have learned my lesson, you hurt me before/But every time I see ya, I keep running back for more,” blows Bell, breaking down romance’s inexplicable two-step with a purposeful stride. –Ryan Dombal\nListen: Archie Bell & the Drells: “Here I Go Again”\nNeil Diamond: “Sweet Caroline” (1969)\nWhen I was little, my best friend’s mom—who’d seen Neil Diamond in concert a dozen times—told me he had “a nice tush.” It was a strange moment—almost traumatic. I was just a kid for chrissakes, and this was an authority figure. But Neil had that kind of power over women and this single is one reason why. It also explains why 12 Songs was a bad idea. –Mark Richardson\nListen: Neil Diamond: “Sweet Caroline”\nFrançoise Hardy: “Tous Les Garcons et Les Filles” (1964)\nThe beat sways, Hardy sings, you swoon. The space between the guitar, bass, drums, and vocals—and that’s all there is on this song—is palpable, and Hardy’s vocal is a nonchalantly solitary midnight waltz through swinging Paris. Makes me want to learn French. –Joe Tangari\nListen: Françoise Hardy: “Tous Les Garcons et Les Filles”\nStevie Wonder: “Uptight (Everything’s Alright)” (1966)\nAfter two years without a major hit—an eternity in the Motown days—and with his voice making the troublesome transition from “Little” to big, 15-year-old Stevie Wonder (with help from a cavalcade of horns) literally laughs through his woes on this No. 3 smash. It’s all in this rich girl/poor boy tale: the freakish optimism, opulent funk, and sneaky sociology. Here, the full breadth of Wonder’s talent starts to come into full view. –Ryan Dombal\nListen: Stevie Wonder: “Uptight (Everything’s Alright)”\nAlbert Ayler: “Ghosts” (1964)\nAyler first recorded his signature piece “Ghosts” in 1964, and it eventually became his most frequently played composition. The shortened version that appears on his 1967 Impulse album Love Cry is perhaps the purest distillation of Ayler’s ecstatic marching-band mode, as he and his brother Donald volley the theme’s simple fanfare back and forth with a joyous, Pentecostal fervor. –Matthew Murphy\nListen: Albert Ayler: “Ghosts”\nStone Poneys: “Different Drum” (1967)\nIt’s not you, it’s Linda Rondstadt. Only in her 1967 Stone Poneys version of Monkees guitarist Mike Nesmith’s “Different Drum”, the country-pop diva would never put it so blandly. “I ain’t saying you ain’t pretty/All I’m sayin’ is I’m not ready,” she avers, standing proud with Nashville strings and “In My Life”–like harpsichord. So… can we stay friends? –Marc Hogan\nListen: Stone Poneys: “Different Drum”\nThe Flirtations: “Nothing But a Heartache” (1969)\nThis is girl-group pop with all the swoony drama that the genre demanded, but it’s also tense and brittle: The horn stabs and string whooshes anticipate the funk and disco that were in their embryonic stages in 1969, and the group sings about heartache like they’re sharpening their teeth. Northern Soul kids picked up on this one for very good reasons. –Tom Breihan\nListen: The Flirtations: “Nothing But a Heartache”\nThe Monks: “Monk Time” (1966)\nIt’s beat time, it’s hop time, it’s Monk time! It’s American punk GIs in Germany destroying everything in sight with overdriven organ, guitar feedback, and electrified banjo. This was not your rank-and-file Army beat group, raging against Vietnam, the Bomb, and complacency. –Joe Tangari\nListen: The Monks: “Monk Time”\nFrank Sinatra: “It Was a Very Good Year” (1965)\nFrank walks the same balancing act as Jay-Z, somehow pulling off the aging Don Juan character and even making himself sympathetic. Strings weep and oboes hum while Sinatra looks back on all the girls he’s fucked with a fond, eloquent melancholy, never dropping his swagger but still letting weariness seep in. Masterful. –Tom Breihan\nListen: Frank Sinatra: “It Was a Very Good Year”\nCromagnon: “Caledonia” (1969)\nA stately funereal march for a whole army of whispering maniacs, “Caledonia”—with its pre-industrial stomp and pre-modern bagpipery—evokes nothing so much as the distant and terrifying future. Like pretty much everything else on the ESP-Disk label, Cromagnon made songs so far ahead of their time we’ve yet to catch up. –Zach Baron\nListen: Cromagnon: “Caledonia”\nThe Who: “I Can See For Miles” (1967)\nAt the time of this song’s release, the Who weren’t pleased with its chart success—it only reached No. 10 in the UK. But while it found them stretching out a bit, it’s really classic Who, with loose, airy verses, tight, catchy choruses, and plenty of wailing from both Pete Townshend and Keith Moon. –Cory D. Byrom\nListen: The Who: “I Can See For Miles”\nThe Zombies: “She’s Not There” (1964)\nIt’s counterintuitively groovy, with its minor-key darkness and halting drum part, but “She’s Not There” is as arresting and mysterious as the girl it describes. Singer Colin Blunstone exudes cool on the verses, obeys the frenzy of the chorus, and lets Rod Argent unload on one of rock’s best electric piano solos. –Joe Tangari\nListen: The Zombies: “She’s Not There”\nOs Mutantes: “A Minha Menina” (1968)\nIn 1968 Brazil, it constituted a political statement for Os Mutantes to perform their brash and radical form of Tropicália. But you’d never guess it from the playful, sunny bounce of “A Minha Menina,” which combines propulsive Latin rhythms, delirious doo-wop choruses, and trebly fuzz guitar to frame a near-perfect slice of carefree boy-meets-girl pop. –Matthew Murphy\nListen: Os Mutantes: “A Minha Menina”\nPink Floyd: “Astronomy Domine” (1967)\nIn a pre–Dark Side of the Moon world, “Astronomy Domine” was Pink Floyd’s calling card, single-handedly generating every space-rock cliché and exposing rock’s true psychedelic potential. Forget Jerry Garcia and Jefferson Airplane: According to Syd Barrett’s brilliantly warped songwriting, mind expansion and intergalactic research could only be conducted through NASA morse code, academic electronics, time-rippling guitar echoes, and tabernacle vocals about Saturnian staircases. –Alex Linhardt\nListen: Pink Floyd: “Astronomy Domine”\nP.P. Arnold: “The First Cut Is the Deepest” (1967)\nEveryone from Rod Stewart to Sheryl Crow has covered this Cat Stevens–penned number, but no one has owned it like Arnold, whose delivery suggests a lively mix of brassy self-possession and courageous vulnerability. Her devastating interpretation outshines the fussily Spector-ian orchestration, making the song a massive monument to a profoundly broken heart. –Stephen M. Deusner\nListen: P.P. Arnold: “The First Cut Is the Deepest”\nAretha Franklin: “Do Right Woman, Do Right Man” (1967)\nFuck Dr. Phil. Fuck Oprah. Fuck “Lovelines” and Dr. Drew. The blueprint to how to treat a woman is delivered by the woman with the voice we all want to educate us. Aretha opens plainly with “Take me to heart and I’ll always love you.” Is there any better way to explain this? –Sean Fennessey\nListen: Aretha Franklin: “Do Right Woman, Do Right Man”\nLoretta Lynn: “Fist City” (1968)\nThe greatest catfight song of all time would be just another sad attempt by a done-wrong woman to stick up for her no-good man if it wasn’t for the vicious glee with which Lynn delivers her threats. It’s almost as if she encourages him to cheat, just so she can get off on beating up the bitch afterward. –Amy Phillips\nListen: Loretta Lynn: “Fist City”\nCreedence Clearwater Revival: “Bad Moon Rising” (1969)\n“Bad Moon Rising” remains the apotheosis of midnight dread: sly rockabilly, cheery resignation, and stab-your-friends paranoia. For all of Fogerty’s lyrical simplicity (“I hear the voice of rage and ruin”), he manages to unite Cambodian monsoons, tear-gassed riots, postdiluvian Apollo missions, and bayou homicide under one ominous eclipse. –Alex Linhardt\nListen: Creedence Clearwater Revival: “Bad Moon Rising”\nThe Kingsmen: “Louie Louie” (1963)\nYou can blear the words and miss your cues. You can play it in a marching band, with the tubas bobbing up and down, farting the hook. You can even, like radio station KFJC, spin 823 different versions by different bands for a straight 63 hours. Go ahead, try anything—because you can’t fuck up “Louie, Louie.” –Chris Dahlen\nListen: The Kingsmen: “Louie Louie”\nLorraine Ellison: “Stay With Me” (1969)\n“Stay With Me” starts with a slow-rotating piano line and a whisper-coo vocal, before it wells up and explodes into one of the great scenery-chewing choruses of all time. An orchestra drops bombs, and Ellison’s voice abandons all restraint, clawing and rasping and howling at the man who’s about to leave her. –Tom Breihan\nListen: Lorraine Ellison: “Stay With Me”\nThe Association: “Never My Love” (1967)\nWhile the Association’s happy-together harmonies might make them seem like just another chirpy pop group aching to be hoisted upon Charles Manson’s petard, there’s a wispy melancholy to “Never My Love” that lifts it above the rabble. This reassuring affirmation of amour is a California dream that knows the alarm could go off at any time, which, in a world of silly love songs, makes all the difference. –David Raposa\nListen: The Association: “Never My Love”\nDavid Axelrod: “The Human Abstract” (1969)\nThis is the kind of primary-source material that lets DJ Shadow records get described as “cinematic”—a bottomless piano figure that ramps up through funk bass, guitar shards, and what we’d now call “breakbeats” to hit a string-drenched climax. This, you know, is the kind of stuff the cool kids listened to. –Nitsuh Abebe\nListen: David Axelrod: “The Human Abstract”\nBob Dylan: “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)” (1965)\nIn many respects, “It’s Alright, Ma” was Dylan’s last word on overt protest music, and he channeled this comprehensive social diatribe with such otherworldly fury that it seemed to awe even himself. “I don’t know how I got to write those songs,” he told Ed Bradley in a 2004 “60 Minutes” interview. “Try and sit down and write something like that.” –Matthew Murphy\nListen: Bob Dylan: “It’s Alright Ma, I’m Only Bleeding”\nArchie Bell & the Drells: “Tighten Up” (1968)\nProzac on wax—one of the simplest, most joyous soul-shouting dance numbers of the decade, built on the only chords that matter. The Drells send their major sevenths strutting and scratching back and forth like they know they’ve found the perfect groove, and the whole thing just beams; you’d be hard pressed to find someone who can hear it without smiling back. –Nitsuh Abebe\nListen: Archie Bell & the Drells: “Tighten Up”\nThe Velvet Underground: “Sister Ray” (1967)\nIt may clock in at 17 minutes, but “Sister Ray” is rock’n’roll debased to it purest, most puerile form: blow jobs, smack, and a ceaseless riff that sounds like “96 Tears” getting cooked in a spoon. Some 26 years later, Jon Spencer would claim, “My father was Sister Ray!” He’s just one of a million garage-rock deviants with a claim to child support. –Stuart Berman\nListen: The Velvet Underground: “Sister Ray”\nNina Simone: “Sinnerman” (1964)\nIt’s the end of the world and whoever sings this spiritual is trying to find a way out. Simone, raised in church, understands the scriptural underpinnings and sounds like she’s riding her piano into town with a column of flame trailing 10 feet behind her. “Urgent” doesn’t begin to describe it. –Mark Richardson\nListen: Nina Simone: “Sinnerman”\nTerry Riley: “In C” (1968)\nWhere Steve Reich’s 1974 modern classical piece “Music for 18 Musicians” throws up a wall of sound that even a packing Phil Spector would have trouble penetrating, Terry Riley’s “In C” hangs like a beaded curtain. Here, minimalism isn’t some totalizing force but a loose scrim dividing sound from silence, music from chaos, and chance from design, as the players attack cell-based arrangements like tipsy bingo players throwing chips to the wind. –Philip Sherburne\nListen: Terry Riley: “In C”\nTammy Wynette: “Stand by Your Man” (1968)\nListening to Tammy Wynette’s hit song now, it’s tough to decide who’s being insulted more—the wife who should forgive her philandering husband, or the husband who, being “just a man,” apparently can’t keep his libido in check. Regardless, the track’s hallmarks—swinging rhythm, teary steel guitar, and aching vocals—are definitive, making it one of the most popular and best-loved songs country music has yet produced. –Cory D. Byrom\nListen: Tammy Wynette: “Stand by Your Man”\nBobbie Gentry: “Ode to Billie Joe” (1967)\nOur “Law & Order”–corroded minds can all-too-easily guess what the singer and Billie Joe tossed off the bridge that night, but this Southern Gothic story-song is still a creeping horror for the way Gentry teases out each character’s reactions to a tragedy—and for the dread that sinks in with every revelation. –Chris Dahlen\nListen: Bobbie Gentry: “Ode to Billie Joe”\nScott Walker: “Big Louise” (1969)\nWith his trembling baritone croon and God’s string section by his side, Scott Walker skillfully straddles the line between true pathos and nauseating bathos. With the weight he imparts to lyrics that are both clumsy scraps of poesy and poignant images (“She’s a haunted house/And her windows are broken”), it doesn’t matter if the song is about an aging prostitute or his favorite soup spoon—he sings this sad tale as if it’s escaping upon his very last breath. –David Raposa\nListen: Scott Walker: “Big Louise”\nProcol Harum: “A Whiter Shade of Pale” (1967)\nThis song, given a bit more than its fair share of exposure via high school dances and movie previews, is nevertheless a pristine example of how far a great melody and chord progression will take you. It doesn’t matter that it’s a Bach rip, or that nobody really knows what Gary Brooker is singing about. –Dominique Leone\nListen: Procol Harum: “A Whiter Shade of Pale”\nThe Supremes: “Baby Love” (1964)\nThe four-bar intro, the ponying piano rhythms, a young Diana Ross’ naifish vocals, the sugary vocal callbacks, the key change; simple economy of songwriting was one of Motown’s defining characteristics, but few tracks from the label’s golden era came as perfectly packaged as this one. –Mark Pytlik\nListen: The Supremes: “Baby Love”\nDonovan: “Season of the Witch” (1966)\nBetter known as a dippy, soft-spoken mystic, Donovan’s claws came out for “Season of the Witch.” This psych-pop seether indicts the singer’s own folkie utopia (“Beatniks are out to make it rich,” he growls) with toothy licks and an organ sheen that may or may not have been courtesy of Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones. –Brian Howe\nListen: Donovan: “Season of the Witch”\nThe Impressions: “People Get Ready” (1965)\nThis song’s sense of strained optimism, of hope in the face of overwhelming sadness, is almost impossibly gorgeous. Everything floats: Curtis Mayfield’s coo, the bluesy guitar, the lighter-than-air strings. When I die and I’m walking toward a faraway glimmer of light, I want this to be the soundtrack. –Tom Breihan\nListen: The Impressions: “People Get Ready”\nThe Righteous Brothers: “Unchained Melody” (1968)\n“Unchained Melody” is an unparalled slow dance song. It keeps turning and unfolding, like an endless, ever-growing love... and yeah, it’s sappy, and deathly sincere. But it’s also stately, and undeniable. Like a great bridge that’s been shot in front of too many sunsets, it can still get to you—depending on your date. –Chris Dahlen\nListen: The Righteous Brothers: “Unchained Melody”\nThe Dixie Cups: “Iko Iko” (1965)\nPart schoolyard taunt, part Mardi Gras chant, part found-sound experiment, “Iko Iko” was allegedly born when New Orleans’ Dixie Cups started singing a hometown melody during downtime in the studio, accompanying themselves by hitting an ashtray, a bottle, and a chair for percussion. Not until the reign of the Neptunes would anything this weirdly minimal again reach the top of the charts. –Amy Phillips\nListen: The Dixie Cups: “Iko Iko”\nJimi Hendrix: “Voodoo Child (Slight Return)” (1968)\nThe stock of the Legendary Rock Titans is taking a dip as idols of the 1960s are replaced on classic rock radio playlists by various Sammy Hagar projects, but I refuse to live in a world where “Voodoo Child” is left behind. This rocks God even when He’s playing hard to get. –Dominique Leone\nListen: Jimi Hendrix: “Voodoo Child (Slight Return)”\nThe Kinks: “Shangri-La” (1969)\n“Shangri-La” makes the quotidian epic, blowing up the fireside rocking chair ride of the pensioner and the commute of the indebted laborer into a cinemascope portrait of the British middle class. It’s not all tea and sympathy: Check the charging middle eight, as vicious a smackdown of the complacent life as any. –Joe Tangari\nListen: The Kinks: “Shangri-La”\nBrian Wilson: “Surf’s Up (solo piano version)” (1966)\nThe lonely boy in his room finally gets the baroque and puzzling lyrics his most complex music deserves. For all the Phil Spector worship and industry cash lavished on fireman’s hats—and once you get past the cutesy intro—“Surf’s Up” shows all Brian needed was a piano to knock you on your can. –Mark Richardson\nListen: Brian Wilson: “Surf’s Up (solo piano version)”\nThe Monkees: “I’m a Believer” (1966)\nWith some of the most recognizable opening notes in pop music, this Neil Diamond–penned gem showcases everything the Monkees had to offer: The melody is infectious, the chorus begs for a sing-along, and by the end, Mickey Dolenz’ vocals are as impassioned as anyone’s. –Cory D. Byrom\nListen: The Monkees: “I’m a Believer”\nLouis Armstrong: “What a Wonderful World” (1968)\nThere’s a battle in here. Without that C# major chord—the one that hits on “and I think to myself”—you might never know it. But in that teetering moment before the chord’s resolution, “What a Wonderful World” makes a subtle heartbreaking gesture to all the darkness rapping at its door (bigotry, weariness, defeat), in turn making it just hard enough for you, the listener, to entirely dismiss its optimism, at which moment the battle becomes yours. –Mark Pytlik\nListen: Louis Armstrong: “What a Wonderful World”\nThe Byrds: “I’ll Feel a Whole Lot Better” (1965)\nOf all the songwriters who rose with the Byrds—Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, Gram Parsons—Gene Clark is the least decorated. But that’s OK—in just 2:35 he basically invents modern power-pop, showing a generation of underdogs (from Big Star to Tom Petty to Teenage Fanclub) how to hide their spite in a joyous, jangly Rickenbacker chord. –Stuart Berman\nListen: The Byrds: “I’ll Feel a Whole Lot Better”\nJohn Coltrane: “My Favorite Things” (1960)\nJohn Coltrane never stopped finding new things in this song. By Live in Japan it was going on for an hour with blistering solos that could peel paint. But this first take is delicate and lyrical, soft but never frail. And the key change after the chorus is among the most joyous sounds in recorded music. –Mark Richardson\nListen: John Coltrane: “My Favorite Things”\nHarry Nilsson: “Everybody’s Talkin’” (1968)\nIt’s still shocking to me that Nilsson didn’t write the harrowing “Everybody’s Talkin.’” A notoriously conflicted guy, Nilsson recorded the Fred Neil song for his 1968 album Aerial Ballet, but it didn’t blow until it became the theme for the 1969 film Midnight Cowboy. It remains one of the truest recordings of emotional distress ever recorded. Too bad Forrest Gump screwed it up for everyone. –Sean Fennessey\nListen: Harry Nilsson: “Everybody’s Talkin’”\nBuffalo Springfield: “For What It’s Worth” (1967)\nOriginally a Stephen Stills track about a club closing in West Hollywood, “For What It’s Worth”—like Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind”—ended up more symbol than song. Neil Young’s insistent, single-note echoes are the sound of a conflict begun; the sides are forgotten—only the flavor of dissatisfaction and dissent remains. –Zach Baron\nListen: Buffalo Springfield: “For What It’s Worth”\nGeorge Jones: “She Thinks I Still Care” (1962)\nElvis Presley and the Flying Burrito Brothers have recorded this masterpiece of self-delusion, but it forever belongs to Jones. Not only is he able to wring out every drop of sad-sack pathos but he’s able to do so with enough natural charisma for listeners to fully sympathize with the song’s vaguely creepy proto-stalker narrator. –Matthew Murphy\nListen: George Jones: “She Thinks I Still Care”\nLed Zeppelin: “What Is and What Should Never Be” (1969)\nSkip the circular medieval hippie-isms, the coital dynamics, the pinging flytrap slide solo, and Plant’s underwater sound effects for a moment. Skip to the 3:33 mark, right when it seems about to disembark. At that exact point, just try not to flail off Page’s staccato sucker punch. –Ryan Dombal\nListen: Led Zeppelin: “What Is and What Should Never Be”\nMiles Davis: “Shhh/Peaceful” (1969)\nFrom Davis’ cosmic In a Silent Way, “Shhh/Peaceful” forecasted a time when only the blur of motion and pulsating waves of rhythm could describe what was happening outside one’s window (or through one’s monitor). Musically, it’s colored with blue ambience and the electric ghosts of drone. But is it jazz? Nobody cares. –Dominique Leone\nListen: Miles Davis: “Shhh/Peaceful”\nThe Velvet Underground: “Venus in Furs” (1967)\nJohn Cale’s screechy viola buzzes like a beeline through trebled guitars and Maureen Tucker’s slow-plod drums. Lou Reed’s lyrics reference Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s 19th century novel, Venus in Furs, in language and imagery that matches (and then laps) that book’s late-romanticism: “Whiplash girl child in the dark/Clubs and bells, your servant, don’t forsake him/Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart.” The sound is lusciously decadent. The march itself feels so perversely languorous—a parade for fur-wearing women and those who desire to submit to them. –Brandon Stosuy\nListen: The Velvet Underground: “Venus in Furs”\nThe Supremes: “I Hear a Symphony” (1965)\nYou can’t blame Holland-Dozier-Holland if this sounds like “Where Did Our Love Go?”—after a rare lackluster performance by a Supremes single, Berry Gordy released an inter-Motown memo telling his staff that this group will release nothing less than No. 1 singles. In response, one of the greatest songwriting teams in American history wrote a soaring anthem that encapsulated the greatness of their entire body of work within one perfect three-minute single that, naturally, reached the top of the charts. –David Raposa\nListen: The Supremes: “I Hear a Symphony”\nPatsy Cline: “I Fall to Pieces” (1961)\nPatsy Cline had a “one of the guys” reputation—she supposedly could drink, cuss, and fight with the best of them. You’d never know it from this weepy pop-country gem. Of strong personal significance for Cline, “I Fall to Pieces” allowed her to break through on her own terms; the walking bass, dry snare, and vocal harmonies were the perfect backdrop for a booming voice that was best heard on heartbreakers. –Cory D. Byrom\nListen: Patsy Cline: “I Fall to Pieces”\nGlen Campbell: “Wichita Lineman” (1968)\nCampbell’s 1968 hit, penned by Jimmy Webb, helped define his career with its slick production and strong melody. The underlying sadness in his smooth vocals was pure country, but the sweeping strings and sparkling production were a fresh pop addition. –Cory D. Byrom\n? and the Mysterians: “96 Tears” (1966)\nOn the smartest/dumbest two-note Farfisa riff in history, “96 Tears” went to No. 1 at a time when a couple of shifty looking guys from Saginaw, Mich., with a shaky grasp on rock’n’roll could do such a thing. I read somewhere, possibly apocryphally, that once at a Suicide show before they performed “96 Tears,” Alan Vega screamed “your national anthem, whether you know it or not!” Works for me. –Jess Harvell\nListen: ? and the Mysterians: “96 Tears”\nSilver Apples: “Oscillations” (1968)\nWhere Morton Subotnick’s “Silver Apples of the Moon” congealed, the Silver Apples’ shiny electro-acoustic baubles actively grooved. Their penchant for quivering electronics—and the self-conscious content of their lyrics, paying tribute to same—laid the groundwork for Krautrock (not to mention American Tapes) with a dazzling, not-quite-three minutes of tribal drumming, gamelan timbres, folky modal harmonies, train whistles—and of course those pesky waveforms, oscillating wildly. –Philip Sherburne\nListen: Silver Apples: “Oscillations”\nThe Bobby Fuller Four“I Fought the Law” (1966)\nBobby Fuller sits in the prison yard with not a hair or a note out of place, and his guitar shines like the sparks off the bullet that ended his life as a free man. As cool a killer as any in rockabilly, he makes the sing-along confession of the title iconic in a song that’s fast, hostile and, doomed—just as Fuller’s own legend was sealed when he was found dead at the height of his stardom, in a suicide that’s still believed to be murder. –Chris Dahlen\nListen: The Bobby Fuller Four: “I Fought the Law”\nBen E. King: “Stand By Me” (1961)\nI always thought this song was longer. King’s telling us that he can endure the end of the world if he has the love of a good woman. But with that steadfast bassline behind him, he doesn’t sound like he needs help—just that he’s looking for a more perfect union, the kind of love that makes us more than just men and women. You hear what that sounds like in the strings, which are almost too beautiful—and stop right before they get mushy. –Chris Dahlen\nListen: Ben E. King: “Stand By Me”\nJefferson Airplane: “White Rabbit” (1967)\nDon’t pay attention to the lyrics. Just don’t. Pay attention to the snaking guitar line, the bolero beat, and Grace Slick’s tremulous voice. And even if you hate hippies as much as I do, pay attention to the closing crescendo. It slays everything in its path: hippies, punks, yuppies, metalheads, even Jefferson Starship. –Amy Phillips\nListen: Jefferson Airplane: “White Rabbit”\nThe Kinks: “Victoria” (1969)\nWith “Victoria,” Ray Davies turns the social critique that always lurks in his songcraft to take on, well, the history of the British Empire—in under four minutes. And as the song moves from wistfully nostalgic verses to soaring, patriotic choruses, he pretty much nails it. God save the Kinks. –John Motley\nListen: The Kinks: “Victoria”\nNancy Sinatra: “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’” (1966)\nThe descending bassline that opens the song feels like a playground taunt, and so does everything else: Sinatra’s blithe and flirty delivery, the skeletal tambourines, even the glorious, stomping horn riff that bursts into the song in its final 20 seconds. “Boots” is maybe the finest bitchy kiss-off in pop history. Take notes. –Tom Breihan\nListen: Nancy Sinatra: “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’”\nThe Easybeats: “Friday on My Mind” (1965)\nBursting out in fab psychedelic Technicolor, Australia’s Easybeats sounded the horn for anyone who’s ever pined for the weekend. Angels at the chorus go, “toniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiggggghhhht,” and if only for a few seconds, tease visions of the city and everything that’s going to happen there. “Friday on My Mind” is the jam. –Dominique Leone\nListen: The Easybeats: “Friday on My Mind”\nSteve Reich: “It’s Gonna Rain” (1965)\nSteve Reich’s most famous tape-loop finds a frothing black-magic Pentecostal minister prepping for street-riot Armageddon. With the assistance of Reich’s gap-ridden tape splicing, his voice transforms into a series of beeps, springs, fans, and artillery fire. Occasionally, it approaches something that resembles serrated doo-wop or the Psycho theme. Fluttering pigeons turn into marching boots. Despite all the violence, “It’s Gonna Rain” is a testament to man’s ability to wrest melody from speech and rhythm from insanity. –Alex Linhardt\nListen: Steve Reich: “It’s Gonna Rain”\nStevie Wonder: “I Was Made to Love Her” (1968)\nFor much of his career no one could fill the world with silly love songs as superlatively as Stevie Wonder. The sunshine soul of 1967’s “I Was Made to Love Her” easily shows up the emptiness of most modern melisma, as the 16-year-old singer’s churchy rejoicing lends a happy ending to a choir-and-harmonica Romeo and Juliet tale of parental disapproval and all-conquering hubba-hubba. –Marc Hogan\nListen: Stevie Wonder: “I Was Made to Love Her”\nThe Four Tops: “It’s the Same Old Song” (1965)\nOh, that groove—it’s so irresistible an entire orchestra had to get involved. Levi Stubbs pumps anguish into the tortured lyric about a guy who can’t escape the song he and his girl once shared. Once loved, now it’s the pain in his heart going out on the airwaves. –Joe Tangari\nListen: The Four Tops: “It’s the Same Old Song”\nThe Byrds: “Eight Miles High” (1966)\nCalling this psychedelia’s greatest pop moment will probably ignite a shitstorm from the peanut gallery, but what the hell, I’ll say it anyway. Normal adjectives like “serpentine” do violence to the guitar playing on “Eight Miles High”; 12 strings manage to snare John Coltrane modal chaos, Indian ragas, and chiming bucolic folk. Not bettered by the (very fine) Hüsker Dü cover, even for those like me who prefer their freakouts to sound like heavy weather. –Jess Harvell\nListen: The Byrds: “Eight Miles High”\nHarry Nilsson: “One” (1968)\nIt opens with a single note over and over and we know the song immediately, no matter who’s performing it. I grew up on Three Dog Night’s R&B bombast so returning to Harry’s original I forget how wispy and ethereal this tune could be. Definitely the loneliest version out there. –Mark Richardson\nListen: Harry Nilsson: “One”\nBob Dylan: “Visions of Johanna” (1966)\nA song that never really ends, about a girl he’s never really gonna find, in a place that he’ll never really leave. Joins fellow Dylan track “Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again” as one of the most immaculate songs about being eternally, existentially, stuck in the same place. “He’s sure got a lot of gall, being so useless and all…” –Zach Baron\nListen: Bob Dylan: “Visions of Johanna”\nDesmond Dekker & the Aces: “007 (Shanty Town)” (1967)\nThe King of Ska brought this loping anthem, about rudeboys that “bomb up de town,” to hordes of tenderfoots. But with a voice as compact and emotive as his, Dekker was capable of enrapturing even the biggest xenophobe. The only reason people can get away with loving ska is still Dekker. –Sean Fennessey\nListen: Desmond Dekker & the Aces: “007 (Shanty Town)”\nSimon & Garfunkel: “America” (1968)\nA short, wistful trip, Bookends’ soft-focus acoustic highlight “America” wasn’t actually a single until it appeared on 1972’s Greatest Hits. Whenever. Dewily harmonious Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel do the she’s-leaving-home myth maybe half as good as Nabokov, but it’s priceless for the gabardine spy alone. –Marc Hogan\nListen: Simon & Garfunkel: “America”\nKing Crimson: “21st Century Schizoid Man” (1969)\nKing Crimson announced itself to the world with this seven-minute hellstorm of gonzo guitar, shifting meters, and nasty sax. Greg Lake sounds like he’s being eaten by robots, and there’s hardly anything more fantastically filthy than Robert Fripp and Ian McDonald’s opening guitar/sax riff. –Joe Tangari\nListen: King Crimson: “21st Century Schizoid Man”\nMerle Haggard: “Mama Tried” (1968)\nWhy Steve Goodman felt the need to pen the perfect country song (his attempt was the 1975 hit “You Never Even Called Me by My Name”) is baffling, as Haggard had done it seven years previous. It’s all here: trains, prison, mama, and the outlaw thread that ran through the country movement for most of the ’70s. –Cory D. Byrom\nListen: Merle Haggard: “Mama Tried”\nSly & the Family Stone: “Everyday People” (1968)\nFamily Stone member Larry Graham claims that the first chart-topping single from one of the first racially integrated mainstream bands also includes the first instance of slap bass. Sly smoothed out his incendiary funk into a couple minutes of gently buoyant pop leavened with nursery-rhyme bridges and soaring choruses, bringing his message of tolerance to less adventurous ears. –Brian Howe\nListen: Sly and the Family Stone: “Everyday People”\nPink Floyd: “See Emily Play” (1967)\nThe highest-charting Syd Barrett–era Floyd single, and the recently deceased star's most accessible song, “See Emily Play” evokes lost childhood as bluntly as anything in his repertoire— it gets wistful right on the second line—but the stabs of steel guitar and the sped-up piano solo transcend cliché. –Chris Dahlen\nListen: Pink Floyd: “See Emily Play”\nThe Isley Brothers: “It’s Your Thing” (1969)\nA molten guitar-and-piano strut bleeds over some serious locked-groove drums and a few perfectly placed horn-stabs, Ronald Isley growls some second-wave feminism, and then the whole vicious lope explodes in a euphoric storm of woozy, joyous psych-funk. The Isleys already had more than a decade of hits behind them in 1969, but they still managed to completely internalize both James Brown’s rigorously amorphous stomp and former sideman Jimi Hendrix’s tumultuous squall, squishing it all into a triumphant marvel of precision-engineering, every musician involved hitting his notes hard at exactly the right moment. –Tom Breihan\nListen: The Isley Brothers: “It's Your Thing”\nJimi Hendrix: “All Along the Watchtower” (1968)\nThis belongs to the most exclusive class of cover versions: One that not only improves on the original, but makes you forget who wrote it in the first place. The words—a comment on class disparity as represented by jokers, thieves, and princes—belong to Bob Dylan, but it’s Hendrix’s despairing performance that lend them continuing relevance, that aching first line ringing truer with each coffin that comes back from Baghdad. And the guitar solos are arguably the most dramatic that Hendrix ever laid down, sounding less like displays of technical virtuosity than pleas for sanity in a world gone to hell. –Stuart Berman\nListen: Jimi Hendrix: “All Along the Watchtower”\nThe Zombies: “Care of Cell 44” (1968)\nFact: “Care of Cell 44,” which opens the Zombies’ psych-pop masterpiece Odessey and Oracle, is the sunniest song ever written about the impending release of a prison inmate. At the end of the first ineffably sing-song verse, Colin Blunstone tells his sweetie, “You can tell me about your prison stay”—and sounds positively tickled. To be fair, describing the song’s lush arrangement and ecstatic melodies as “sunny” is a vast understatement. Every time Blunstone belts out, “Feels! So! Good! You're coming home soon!” after the lull of a Beach Boys–style multi-part harmony, it sounds like his heart’s burst with joy. –John Motley\nListen: The Zombies: “Care of Cell 44”\nThe Maytals: “Pressure Drop” (1969)\n“Pressure Drop” was covered by the Clash and the Specials, but the definitive version is still the original, performed by the Maytals (later to become Toots and the Maytals after their lead singer, Frederick “Toots” Maytal, gained some post-incarceration notoriety). Toots’ opening melody alone is almost too sweet and desperate to bear—always faster than you remember it, far stronger than you thought possible. He less sings than rips through the rest of it. It’s a revenge song—“when it drops, oh you gonna feel it, know that you were doing wrong”—but when Toots cries, “It is you,” it sounds like love. –Zach Baron\nListen: The Maytals: “Pressure Drop”\nThe Shangri-Las: “Give Him a Great Big Kiss” (1965)\n“When I say I'm in love, you best believe I'm in love—l-u-v!” Sadly bereft of the ambient effects that feature so distinctively on Shangri-Las’ singles, “Give Him a Great Big Kiss” nevertheless features one of the foursome’s most striking spoken-word sections. One girl asks her friend how her man dances; she replies: “Close... very, very close.” The fear and excitement in those four words could make anybody want to kiss him—and enough handclap ra-ra in the chorus (plus a kiss sound-effect!) to make everybody else jealous. –Zach Baron\nListen: The Shangri-Las: “Give Him a Great Big Kiss”\nSam Cooke: “Cupid” (1961)\nIt’s not the dumbest lyrical conceit ever, but it’s up there: Sam Cooke is worried that the girl he loves doesn’t know he exists, so he asks the Roman god of erotic love to smooth things out for him. But in the hands of Sam Cooke, it sounds as natural as breathing. The gently rippling drums, the soft and plaintive trumpet, and the frosty hum of the strings mesh together into a luxuriant bed for Cooke’s gorgeously airy falsetto. Cooke had the preternatural ability to turn any cliché into gospel truth, and that searching, wounded coo just melts over everything. –Tom Breihan\nListen: Sam Cooke: “Cupid”\nSimon & Garfunkel: “Mrs. Robinson” (1968)\nThe disparity between “Mrs. Robinson”’s jaunty music and elegiac lyrics might stem from the circumstances of its creation—asked for music for The Graduate, Paul Simon dusted off an unfinished instrumental, dropped in the jailbait-seducing lead's name, and built a requiem for America's lost idealism around it. Slinky acoustic rhythm guitars, bluesy licks, and pattering congas give out to an infectious 4/4 stomp slicked with the folkies’ seamless harmonies. An odd but true-ringing amalgamation of religious piety, stern pedantry, and suburban circumspection fills out the twilit corners of this shrine to our nation’s mythological age of innocence. –Brian Howe\nListen: Simon & Garfunkel: “Mrs. Robinson”\nCan: “Yoo Doo Right” (1969)\nCan were digging out beats from the mud with the muscle of Community and Industry behind their electro-acoustics and MANIA ROCK POWER. Forget “krautrock”—this was actual, in-the-resonance acid-truth music; stuff that might send your buttoned-downs into the next room, but made much easier any ideas you wanted to entertain regarding quantum mechanics. Liebezeit is of course bigger than Jesus. Tape loops are the self-contained shit. “Yoo Doo Right” is the kind of thing that should keep people at shows way too late, filling the street with freak drug youths night after night. And Malcolm Mooney was a bad man. Malcolm Mooney was a bad man. –Dominique Leone\nListen: Can: “Yoo Doo Right”\nNick Drake: “River Man” (1969)\nTwo albums before his solemn swan song Pink Moon, Nick Drake was already meditating on some oppressively heavy topics. With its fixation on the relentless passing of time, “River Man” is the loveliest and most delicate of those from his debut, Five Leaves Left. Over plaintive strums, Drake’s mournful voice paints images of fallen leaves, passing seasons, and the flowing river. What Drake does with his voice and an acoustic guitar is haunting enough, but it’s Harry Robinson’s string arrangement that makes it absolutely chilling. Singing the “Prufrock”-inspired refrain of “How they come and go,” Drake’s voice is swallowed up by the strings, which swell like a rising tide. –John Motley\nListen: Nick Drake: “River Man”\nThe Who: “Substitute” (1966)\nWhile rumors have long been snuffed that “Substitute” stems from Pete Townshend’s Rolling Stones–fueled inferiority complex, this self-righteous power-pop lament never took America by storm like similar rockers “Satisfaction” or “Day Tripper,” and it’s difficult to understand why. Maybe we weren't ready for the cunning lyrics, Keith Moon’s whopping fills, or, my lord, John Entwhistle’s anachronistic, shredding bassline. Even more salient with today’s listeners, Roger Daltrey turns the sunny 60s frontman persona on its head, howling about superficiality, duplicity, and social class. Ultimately the song taps just the right amount of angst, hitting that sweet spot between libertine classic rock and the austere, self-important grunge movement it no doubt helped inspire. –Adam Moerder\nListen: The Who: “Substitute”\nThe Angels: “My Boyfriend’s Back” (1963)\nNot so much about a boyfriend than about one boy coming home to beat the living hell out of another boy, this 1963 single, originally meant for the Shirelles, is one of the most flat-out mean girl-group tracks ever. College coeds will forever sing it when their high school beaus come to visit, but unless said beau is punching a few suitors in the face on arrival, he’s missing the spirit of the whole thing. –Zach Baron\nListen: The Angels: “My Boyfriend’s Back”\nThe Stooges: “1969” (1969)\nThe first thing you hear is the groove: tribal drums falling down stairs, guitar and bass flaring into an eternal Link Wray jungle-stomp, before the guitar flares up into a gooey, miasmic haze. If “1969” was an instrumental, it’d be a psychedelic-funk classic. But of course all anyone talks about is Iggy Pop’s bored, detached sneer, the way he dismisses what looks in retrospect like a season of upheaval as “another year with nothing to do.” When you’ve got a groove like that behind you, anything you say starts to take on a blasphemous weight. –Tom Breihan\nListen: The Stooges: “1969”\nThe Kinks: “You Really Got Me” (1964)\nVan Halen’s equally popular 1977 cover added an orgasmic breakdown chorus of “oohs” and “aahs,” but that was just DLR being redundant. Because the original’s caustic riff says it all: These guys are packing the biggest set of blue balls known to man. But what makes “You Really Got Me” so fearsome and ferocious after 41 years isn’t its everlasting theme of unrequited teenage lust. It’s that within Ray Davies’ sneering, leering delivery, we hear the threat of violence that will result if he doesn’t get what he wants. –Stuart Berman\nListen: The Kinks: “You Really Got Me”\nThe Miracles: “The Tracks of My Tears” (1965)\nThe hit factory at Motown built songs to last and this Miracles tune is one of its most enduring. “The Tracks of My Tears” is so meticulously constructed that it rolls over the competition. And it’s so deceptively simple that its genius actually isn’t easy to trace. But from the moment the drums drop over the gentle, twanging guitar intro to Smokey Robinson’s vocal improvisations over blasting horns as it fades out, every piece fits together perfectly. –John Motley\nListen: The Miracles: “The Tracks of My Tears”\nThe Left Banke: “Walk Away Renée” (1967)\nDouble-edged sword: If the pseudo-classical pop-rock band the Left Banke’s keyboardist, Michael Brown, hadn’t been obsessed with guitarist Tom Finn’s girlfriend, the band might’ve lasted longer, but never would’ve written the fey weeper about secret longing and unrequited love upon which the Left Banke made their name. The saturated strings and mincing harpsichord are moving in and of themselves, but Steve Martin’s aching rendition of Brown’s teary-eyed proto-emo lyrics are more essential to the song’s longevity—most everyone can identify with the gloomy romance of rain on empty sidewalks, and pining away for your buddy’s girl never goes out of style. –Brian Howe\nListen: The Left Banke: “Walk Away Renée”\nRoy Orbison: “Crying” (1962)\nRoy Orbison never shied from rockabilly swagger, but it was his ballads of unrequited love that made him a legend. In this pocket-sized soap opera, Orbison discovers he’s far from over an ex when the touch of her hand sends him over the edge, wringing his eyes out in agony. He’s not just “crying,” either. He's “cry-i-i-ing” in an angelic falsetto—with a cooing chorus of voices backing up his sob story. You’d never guess melodrama could be so wrenching until Orbison moves a couple octaves deeper for his show-stopping finale. –John Motley\nListen: Roy Orbison: “Crying”\nThe Rolling Stones: “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” (1969)\nColor me raised by a boomer, but this song contains one of the most important pieces of information to come out of the 1960s: Despite all the shit you go through to get what and who you want, and despite any good you might have accidentally done on the side, sometimes you just don’t have it. This was a surprising thing to hear from the Stones, but it could have been a Zen koan—“Try, and do not try. Nothing is achieved.” And let’s be real: This band never sounded better than in 1969-71. Listen to the girls singing backup. Really, anytime you have the Stones using maracas and bongos, something good is going to happen. –Dominique Leone\nListen: The Rolling Stones: “You Can’t Always Get What You Want”\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse: “Down by the River” (1969)\nWritten in the throes of an illness, “Down by the River” grew into an epic fever-nightmare tortured enough to state more clearly than any other song why Young was so out of step with his idealistic peers. The silly hippie dreams of redemption—“she could take me over the rainbow”—are immediately quashed by murder imagery, sung in pained, off-key Crazy Horse harmonies. Then the rest of the song is a blank two-chord page for Neil to scrawl his jagged guitar tone all over, two marathon solos played with zero technical flash and every note taking another awful stab into that failed hope’s body. –Rob Mitchum\nListen: Neil Young & Crazy Horse: “Down by the River”\nElvis Presley: “Suspicious Minds” (1969)\nPerhaps controversially, I find late-period Vegas showman Elvis more thrilling than Elvis in his historic Sun Records days; it’s an image that better lives up to the massive mythology he inspired. Fortunately, “Suspicious Minds” offers the best of both worlds: It’s gritty and funky enough to recall those Memphis days, but laden with enough garish audio glitter—the backup singers, the false ending, the swooping strings—to befit a legend. –Rob Mitchum\nListen: Elvis Presley: “Suspicious Minds”\nSam & Dave: “Hold On, I’m Comin’” (1966)\nLook, it’s not brain surgery. You come up with an absolutely undeniable monster of a six-note horn riff. You put it over a wound-tight funk vamp that breathes and lunges and builds to a fiery climax. You find a couple of guys to bray and scream and plead and rage over it with a sort of churchy zeal. That’s it. You are now Isaac Hayes and Dave Porter, and you’ve written maybe the greatest Southern soul song of all time. You’ll start getting burger-commercial royalties in about 30 years. –Tom Breihan\nBob Dylan: “Subterranean Homesick Blues” (1965)\nThis flurry feels like a how-to farmer’s almanac for the 1960s counterculture—a speed-freak call from the streets and the Invisible Man’s basement, offering tricks, warnings, puns, paranoia, LSD concoctions, protest, and fire hose–toting cops. It’s famous for the cue card–toting video from Don’t Look Back (complete with Allan Ginsberg cameo). I’d venture to say Dylan was ultimately the more interesting poet and this spazzed Beat stuffing breeds the blues with Jack Kerouac and Pete Seeger. Even the seemingly tossed-off notions—writing in Braille or watching parking meters— bloom into great thought lines. Everyone’s trying to blend in one way or another—the plain clothes cops, the hippies not wearing sandals. –Brandon Stosuy\nListen: Bob Dylan: “Subterranean Homesick Blues”\nGal Costa: “Baby” (1969)\nKnowing no Portuguese, I imagine Costa’s singing not to a lover but to an actual baby—a six-monther, cradled in her lap and listening to a voice that’s loving and cool. And while she and the slow bossa nova are entrancing, the fantastic strings are the wild card: dipping and flittering, they collide mid-air like two matched flocks of tropical birds. If it’s sexy, it’s laughing during the act, and the baby in the crib nearby doesn’t mind. –Chris Dahlen\nListen: Gal Costa: “Baby”\nSly & the Family Stone: “I Want to Take You Higher” (1969)\nSly Stone’s ode to letting music take hold is not about marching on Washington. And it’s not about spitting in The Man’s face. But it’s definitely about freedom at any cost. The baton-pass of Rose, Freddie, and Sly Stone and the basso profundo of Larry Graham elevate what is in some ways Sly’s most lyrically toothless number into a rapturous call-and-response jam that rocked thousands at Woodstock (or so Mom told us), and even more than that at supermarkets near you every day. But Sly knew what he was doing, slotting the amorphous and joyful “Higher” as the B-side to the more righteous “Stand!” It predicted everything about the next few years from Sly: joy and pain, fun and fire, truth and fucking, darkness and drugs. The perfect antithesis in a career marked by duality. –Sean Fennessey\nListen: Sly & the Family Stone: “I Want to Take You Higher”\nThe Velvet Underground: “Heroin” (1967)\nAnother of Lou Reed’s inner monologues detailing the poetry of negation, this depicts the solitary sacredness of a high, the ritual of shooting up/zoning: “I have made the big decision/I'm gonna try to nullify my life.” I could retitle it “I’ll Be Your Shattered Mirror”—the protagonist feels like a fucked-up everyman, despite the first person. Sonically, it builds like it could arc forever: Drink coffee, press play, feel the noisy viola inject a frenzy. All the sounds are intensely perfect, but Moe Tucker’s drums are the manic pulse: If she stops, the high’s kaput. –Brandon Stosuy\nListen: The Velvet Underground: “Heroin”\nBBC Radiophonic Workshop: “Doctor Who (Original Theme)” (1963)\nWhere the U.S.’s “Star Trek” sent a sleek vessel into “the final frontier,” Britain’s “Dr. Who” began with a cranky old alien hurtling around in a phone booth—and the theme song couldn’t be a better fit. While Ron Grainer’s swooping melody and throbbing beat have seen slicker arrangements over the decades, this first version is an incredible piece of primitive electronic music. Delia Derbyshire constructed it in 1963 by manipulating sounds from test tone generators and mixing them together almost note by note, yet the cobbled-together, almost mismatched timbres come together in a lumpy, throbbing—and definitely futuristic—whole. –Chris Dahlen\nListen: BBC Radiophonic Workshop: “Doctor Who (Original Theme)”\nSimon & Garfunkel: “The Boxer” (1969)\nTwo reasons this is the best of many good S&G songs. First, Paul Simon never wrote a better melody. It bends and turns—and yes, drifts—like it’s going to lose its way until he tugs it back in for a chorus that every kid in the 1970s memorized before grade school. And then the lyrics, from a guy given to saying too much, are terrifically restrained and open-ended, with only the barest hints of the story fleshed out. It’s an impressionistic, painterly approach not far from where Bob Dylan would be a few years later on Blood on the Tracks. –Mark Richardson\nListen: Simon & Garfunkel: “The Boxer”\nJames Brown & the Famous Flames: “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” (1965)\nAlmost everyone with even a passing interest in JB knows the story of how, while stopping off on tour to record a new single, the raggedy, exhausted band inched as if waist-deep in swamp water through a slower, more grinding version of “Papa’s” than the one everyone knows. Someone got the bright idea to get nice with the razor blades and the knob marked “speed everything up,” and funk got one step closer to becoming its own genre. Like a lot of music on this list, “Papa’s” can seem overfamiliar, but Brown’s shift from one of the best ballad singers and soulmen of the early 1960s to the Godfather is still one of the most remarkable transformations in pop history, and this is one of its key moments. –Jess Harvell\nListen: James Brown & the Famous Flames: “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag”\nBob Dylan: “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right” (1963)\nWith the millions of words written on the political and cultural significance of Bob Dylan’s career, it’s easy to forget that dude could write a pretty damn fierce breakup song, when he wanted to. “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right” may be the most venomous of Dylan’s “so long, honeybabe” tracks, in part due to the laid-back, icy delivery of its original version. When he gets to the cruel punch line of “you just kinda wasted my... precious time,” it’s shrugged off like a business transaction, a relationship diss track he can hardly be bothered to sing. –Rob Mitchum\nListen: Bob Dylan: “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right”\nVan Morrison: “Sweet Thing” (1968)\nSurely, scores of grass-kissing, mass Romantics have tried to hole away with a couple of their jazzbo buds for a couple deep nights in search of the next Astral Weeks. Such is the seduction of the quick muse. Of course, it’s going to sound like shit because, however hard your scatman broheim tries to grimace and spasm like he’s feeling the force, he’s not channeling his past with folky pathos set to stun—he’s not Van Morrison. “Sweet Thing” is that one thing; sprightly bows sloping down streets, flutes searching through the mist, and elated bass leading to a fountain of youth. “It feels right, but I can’t say for sure what it means,” Lester Bangs said of it. Of course he can’t. –Ryan Dombal\nListen: Van Morrison: “Sweet Thing”\nJimi Hendrix: “Manic Depression” (1967)\nA showcase for Hendrix’s wholly original guitar techniques, “Manic Depression” is dizzying with its odd time signature and winding, cyclical melody. And while Hendrix will always be the focal point of his songs, the Experience shouldn’t be entirely written off. Drummer Mitch Mitchell is a beast here, pounding every drum in the kit, often leaving bassist Noel Redding to keep things grounded. Lyrically, the song is typical Hendrix—women, drugs, music, and just getting along, man. But that’s neither here nor there: When you’re watching the World Series, what the announcers are saying is beside the point. –Cory D. Byrom\nListen: Jimi Hendrix: “Manic Depression”\nPatsy Cline: “Crazy” (1961)\nWith Top 10 performances on both the country and pop charts, “Crazy” was the first indication that Patsy Cline’s appeal is pretty damn universal. On this Willie Nelson–penned heartbreaker, the music—all loping bass and twinkling piano runs—plays it cool, but Cline’s voice is so cuttingly clear and emotive it’s like she's right there in the room with you. As she sings, “I knew you’d love me as long as you wanted/And then some day, you’d leave me for somebody new,” there’s palpable sorrow and self-loathing in her delivery that makes misery sound exquisite. –John Motley\nListen: Patsy Cline: “Crazy”\nDick Dale & the Del-Tones: “Misirlou” (1962)\nAccording to headshop t-shirts, Charlie don’t surf, but if he did, this is what would’ve been blasting out of his Victrola. Dick Dale made surf music for bikers: “Misirlou” isn’t an occasion to catch a wave, it’s an invitation to a knife fight, and that bee-swarm guitar line takes on all comers—a cha-cha rhythm, a trumpet chorus, even a piano solo—and slays them all. “Misirlou” wasn’t just punk rock before punk existed—it was punk rock even before rock’n’roll became boring enough to make punk necessary. –Stuart Berman\nListen: Dick Dale & the Del-Tones: “Misirlou”\nThe Shirelles: “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow” (1960)\nCarole King was a better songwriter than singer/songwriter, though Tapestry is probably about due for a too-ironic revival. On this 1960 release, the Shirelles take the Brill Building doo-wop and enchantment-under-the-sea strings of King’s “Will You Love Me Tomorrow” and sanctify it with modest, youthful wisdom. Other 60s girl-group ballads would be huger, or more dramatic, but the understated pathos of “Will You Love Me Tomorrow” is singularly combustible. I feel the earth move. –Marc Hogan\nListen: The Shirelles: “Will You Love Me Tomorrow”\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse: “Cinnamon Girl” (1969)\nThe “riff” in this one is a sludge of lumbering power chords and the solo is a single note; even at the beginning of his Crazy Horse era in 1969, Young’s guitar playing had already started to crystallize into something shambolic and occasionally counterintuitive. The sweetness in the burr is all the melodic things happening: the conversations between the vocal harmonies, the guitars and bass, the high and low ends. So what if it’s one of Young’s most superficial songs—in so many other ways, its ragged musculature perfectly encapsulates everything he ever did best. –Mark Pytlik\nListen: Neil Young & Crazy Horse: “Cinnamon Girl”\nThe Paragons: “The Tide Is High” (1967)\nViolin isn’t common in reggae, but damn it sounds good on this gem from the rocksteady era. I’m amazed you can fit this much melody in one song—John Holt’s lead vocal swoops and dives, his phrases expanding and contracting like the very tide itself, while the doo-wop interjections of his mates weave around him like chips of glass in a kaleidoscope. Duke Reid’s band lays down a classic track stuffed with details—a muted guitar hook, a ridiculously sublime violin solo, the way the chorus sounds great no matter what order its halves are sung in—and the result is one of the best Jamaican tracks in pop history. –Joe Tangari\nListen: The Paragons: “The Tide Is High”\nThe Mamas & the Papas: “California Dreamin’” (1966)\nApparently it’s so dreadful not to live in California, it drove the Mamas & Papas to create one of the most beautifully eerie harmony-pop songs in rock history. Thanks to the limitations of 1966 production, John and Michelle Phillips’ reverb-waterlogged four-part arrangement sounds apocalyptically choral, making the experience of actually suffering through four seasons sound positively ghastly. –Rob Mitchum\nListen: The Mamas & the Papas: “California Dreamin’”\nDel Shannon: “Runaway” (1961)\nSo spare it’s almost not there at all, Shannon’s masterpiece is teen heartbreak in haiku, winnowed down from a 15-minute vamp into a perfect 2:20. A No. 1 smash in 1961, rock’n’roll through and through, “Runaway” is also a proto-synth pop hit, introducing the electric musitron with a wicked solo. Shannon’s hiccuping, froggy falsetto details the most basic of breakup stories, and yet it resonates like cosmic truth. Despite lacking the “yeah, well, fuck you too” vitriol of garage groups like the Seeds, hundreds of punks and proto-punks heard, for better or worse, a whole aesthetic universe in “Runaway.” It’s one of the most coverable songs of all time. –Jess Harvell\nListen: Del Shannon: “Runaway”\nStan Getz & João Gilberto: “The Girl From Ipanema” [ft. Antônio Carlos Jobim] (1964)\nWhile the titular object of desire is described as walking “like a samba,” the breezy wisp of a song she saunters through has become synonymous with bossa nova, which emphasizes subtle melodic phrasing over dance-oriented cadence. Bossa nova pioneer Tom Jobim’s bittersweet ode to the unattainable allure of youthful beauty turned the still-young Brazilian genre into a household name in the United States. Astrud Gilberto’s dreamy lilt and João Gilberto’s succinct flecks of guitar describe the mesmerizing syncopation of rolling hips, while Getz blows his sax as sweetly as any drug-crazed wife-beater ever did. –Brian Howe\nListen: Stan Getz & João Gilberto: “The Girl From Ipanema” [ft. Antônio Carlos Jobim]\nThe Rolling Stones: “Street Fighting Man” (1968)\nOn this searing call-to-arms the Stones set the impending revolution under an appropriately intense summer sun, and heat rolls off of it in waves. Brightly jagged guitars glitter like blacktop mirages; thunderous percussion cracks asphalt; Jagger’s voice is a wowing police siren. The music is emphatic; the prognosis is dire but vague; and the upshot, ambivalent: “What can a poor boy do except sing for a rock’n’roll band?” Thankfully so: If they cared too much, they wouldn’t be the Stones. –Brian Howe\nListen: The Rolling Stones: “Street Fighting Man”\nThe Supremes: “You Keep Me Hangin’ On” (1966)\nThis Motown masterpiece has been rerecorded as rock, country, and new wave pop. No wonder: Its unceasing beat, bright guitar chirping, horn blasts, and bubbling bass line make it arguably the most rock-influenced hit of the group’s career, and suited for any setting. Nobody has sold it better, however, than Diana Ross, who somehow manages to sound heartbroken and sassy at the same time. –Cory D. Byrom\nListen: The Supremes: “You Keep Me Hangin’ On”\nSly & the Family Stone: “Hot Fun in the Summertime” (1969)\nSly Stewart’s band could play anything, and here they lay out plush vibes over words that seem a bit realist (moral: things come and go?). No surprise, however, that it’s the sweet and psychedelic soul sounds that win out. Or do they? Sometimes, this song becomes an actual source of nostalgia for me, making me think about someone's old summers when both the sun and fun were hot. But then the bridge happens, and the bass drops out, and even though I know that summer ends soon, and that I’m constantly running out of time, and that life is just a meaningless exchange of particles—well, fuck it, things come and go. –Dominique Leone\nListen: Sly & the Family Stone: “Hot Fun in the Summertime”\nThe Velvet Underground: “Sunday Morning” (1967)\nThe Velvets rap is always about “influence,” but how many artists influenced both the Strokes and Belle and Sebastian? The opener to 1967’s The Velvet Underground & Nico has more in common with the latter, as John Cale’s celeste tinkles beside the feedback wash of Sterling Morrison’s bass-guitar plod, and Lou Reed’s gentle melody explains what an early-morning comedown felt like before Crate & Barrel invented downtempo. It’s a walk of no shame, solitary and serene despite submerged bursts of paranoia. Like their non-evil twins the Modern Lovers, the Velvet Underground introduced not so much a sound as an aesthetic, and that’s pretty hard to bite. –Marc Hogan\nListen: The Velvet Underground: “Sunday Morning”\nThe Beatles: “I Want to Hold Your Hand” (1964)\nSomething about a Kennedy dying, and an airplane arriving in New York. And though the Beatles got more consistently great—or at least more self-consciously artistic after their initial impact—they never really got much better than 1964 and “I Want to Hold Your Hand.” People still won’t shut up about Kurt Cobain mish-mashing the Beatles and Black Sabbath, but here are the Fabs themselves shaking up both twee and punk before either was invented. –Marc Hogan\nListen: The Beatles: “I Want to Hold Your Hand”\nTommy James & the Shondells: “Crimson and Clover” (1969)\nNot gonna front: I loved Joan Jett’s version first. But her cover rocks too hard. This song—quite possibly the closest white pop musicians have ever come to approximating how making love actually feels—is meant to be an afternoon roll in the hay, not an alleyway screw. Even though the climaxes are certainly there, “Crimson and Clover” isn’t about the payoff, it’s about the journey: those three chords descending like pieces of clothing hitting the floor, the sweaty droplets of reverb, the backbeat thrusts. Over and over, over and over. –Amy Phillips\nListen: Tommy James & the Shondells: “Crimson and Clover”\nSerge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot: “Bonnie and Clyde” (1968)\nDuring his collaborations with then-lover Brigitte Bardot, Gainsbourg nurtured a near-Warholian obsession with American iconography: Ford Mustangs (bang!), Coca-Cola, comic strips, and, of course, gangsters. Portraying himself as a cultural outlaw (which, in his most transgressive work, he undoubtedly was), Gainsbourg narrates the lives and deaths of the infamous bank robbers. For listeners who don't parlez français, it’s one of Gainsbourg’s most fascinating songs in that, from start to finish, it never really changes. Its acoustic foundation is miraculously filled out by a fat, creeping bassline, dizzy strings, and a bizarre hiccupping backing vocal, all of which turn simple strums into something hypnotizing. –John Motley\nListen: Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot: “Bonnie and Clyde”\nJackie Wilson: “(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher” (1967)\nIt’s no shock that the finest four-stringer to ever lay in the cut, James Jamerson, provided the base for Wilson’s late-1960s resurrection. With the can’t-miss arrangement, the then-33-year-old Detroit deity emotes with enough searing intensity to even explode through today’s layers of post-pop cynicism. Truth is, there’s not much depth. But Wilson’s idyllic, soulmate destination is so inviting that, by the time the horns sweep in, you may stop snickering at Brangelina and start to appreciate their forever bond. The thing can move mile-high peaks—or at least the Statue of Liberty. –Ryan Dombal\nListen: Jackie Wilson: “(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher”\nThe Monkees: “Daydream Believer” (1967)\nThere’s something extra-touching about a band that’s ostensibly “for the kids” singing a song about the end of childhood. The lolling piano line and the big, bright chorus—“Cheer up sleepy Jean”—are irresistible to people of all ages, but there’s something moving about the way the narrator’s daydreams are ever-so-slightly punctured in the verses: Even a young kid glued to the Monkees’ TV show knows that the sweet comes with the bitter, so why try to hide it? –Chris Dahlen\nListen: The Monkees: “Daydream Believer”\nLed Zeppelin: “Whole Lotta Love” (1969)\nAccording to Joy Press and Simon Reynolds’ The Sex Revolts, American soldiers in Vietnam would ride into battle blasting “Whole Lotta Love,” the part where it roars out of its fuzzed-out miasmic free-jazz middle section and back into its titanic brontosaurus riff. It’s a terrifying image, bloodthirsty heavily armed children fueling themselves with the heaviest, most violent music available. But it’s oddly exhilarating, too, and that’s the genius of the song. Zeppelin turned teenage sex-drive into apocalyptic precision-tooled violence. Even in that experimental stretch, the peals of feedback sound like bombs falling. –Tom Breihan\nListen: Led Zeppelin: “Whole Lotta Love”\nRay Charles: “Georgia on My Mind” (1960)\nIn its conception, “Georgia on My Mind” was about songwriter Hoagy Carmichael’s sister, not the Peach State. But when native Georgian Ray Charles wrapped his sultry pipes around it, it became an obvious choice for official state song, despite the weird image of a landmass competing with “other arms” and “other eyes” for the singer’s affections. (Come to think of it, that’s a rather odd thing to write about one’s sister as well.) The string section hovers just this side of schmaltz, and Charles’ twinkling piano and supple inflections imbue the song with an elegiac sway, peaceful as those moonlit pines. –Brian Howe\nListen: Ray Charles: “Georgia on My Mind”\nIke & Tina Turner: “River Deep - Mountain High” (1966)\nThe lyrics are a string of weak, almost corny analogies, like something someone who’s not much with words would write in a one-year anniversary card—and so Tina Turner has no choice but to belt them from every inch of her lungs to get her point across. She holds her own against one of the biggest of Phil Spector’s “wall of sound” productions, while the orchestra and chorus boom and clamor like a dictator’s rally. As hair-tearingly overpowering as the love she describes, “River Deep - Mountain High” has nothing left to hold back. –Chris Dahlen\nListen: Ike & Tina Turner: “River Deep, Mountain High”\nLove: “Alone Again Or” (1967)\nWritten by Love guitarist Bryan MacLean, “Alone Again Or” was in its original conception a simple, flamenco-tinged folk song. But as the opening and greatest track on Love’s 1967 magnum opus Forever Changes, it became a perfect reflection of the L.A. group’s unique and conflicted dynamic. Producer Bruce Botnick enlisted David Angel to supply the distinctive mariachi horn section and Nelson Riddle–like string arrangements that provide the song its strange, out-of-time luster. Meanwhile, bandleader Arthur Lee infamously mixed his own harmony vocals louder than MacLean’s lead vocal to give the track an asymmetric wobble to match its elliptical title, and lending MacLean’s heart-stirring, alone-in-a-crowd lyricism an added degree of poignancy. –Matthew Murphy\nListen: Love: “Alone Again Or”\nLee Hazlewood & Nancy Sinatra: “Some Velvet Morning” (1968)\nEven after thousands of listens, I still don’t know quite what to make of this bizarre, creepy song. A country-outlaw singer drowning in a pool of reverb, constantly interrupted by dazed-hippie interludes, and haunted by a storm cloud orchestra. Sure, Phaedra is part of a Greek myth and all, but I prefer to think of “Some Velvet Morning” as a love song to drug rehab, Hazlewood longing for a time when he’ll be sober enough to reminisce about his addiction (ephedra = amphetamine, natch) and Sinatra in the role of the drug-personified siren calling him back to her clutches. –Rob Mitchum\nListen: Lee Hazlewood & Nancy Sinatra: “Some Velvet Morning”\nDavid Bowie: “Space Oddity” (1969)\nBowie’s first bona fide hit, “Space Oddity” was rush-released to coincide with the Apollo 11 moon landing. The lyrics, with their strong ties to 2001: A Space Odyssey, tell the sad and paranoid story of poor Major Tom, lost in the void of space. They’ve alternately been interpreted to be about drug abuse, and the psychedelic folk backdrop certainly supports the position that Tom’s experiencing the bad trip to end all bad trips. But while the themes foreshadow the symbolic sci-fi narratives in Bowie’s first true taste of superstardom—the Ziggy Stardust era—the song stands on its own, showcasing Bowie’s gifts for building atmosphere through arrangements and thematic elements. –Cory D. Byrom\nListen: David Bowie: “Space Oddity”\nThe Beatles: “Eleanor Rigby” (1966)\nBig ups to George Martin, who wrote the score for the eight-piece string section (four violins, two cellos, and two violas) floating behind Paul McCartney’s libretto (with assistance from John Lennon and George Harrison on the harmonizing and background vocals). The meditation on loneliness is just over two minutes long, but the characters are fleshed out so strongly that each individual feels packed with a novel’s worth of details. When the stars come together—“Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name/Nobody came/Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave/No one was saved”—think back to Rigby cleaning up the post-wedding rice. She and McKenzie partake in these solitary rituals constantly—never finding a conscious overlap. Seems bizarre that it was released as a single with “Yellow Submarine”: Let's paint the Revolver black. –Brandon Stosuy\nListen: The Beatles: “Eleanor Rigby”\nThe Creation: “Making Time” (1967)\nThat riff’s an instant mod flashpoint on par with “I Can’t Explain” or “You Really Got Me,” but only in the parallel universe ruled by Max Fischer did this song achieve the same legendary status. What differentiates “Making Time” from its peers is that it trades in teen angst for ennui: Kenny Pickett sings, “Why do we have to carry on/Always singing the same old song,” so after the second chorus guitarist Eddie Phillips obliges him and changes the tune, slashing a violin bow across his fret board—years before Jimmy Page stole the shtick—and inverting the song’s riff into something far nastier. They may have been called the Creation, but they excelled at the art of destruction. –Stuart Berman\nListen: The Creation: “Making Time”\nDusty Springfield: “Son of a Preacher Man” (1968)\nAretha Franklin famously rejected this song, only deciding to record it once she heard Springfield’s version. Lyrically, it's clichéd, trite even. Good girl and equally good boy meet, sneak off, give in to each other: It’s a Danielle Steel novel waiting to happen. But Springfield’s quavering tenor is clear and warm enough to turn an underwritten character into an archetype, and it dissolves into the glistening guitars and hard-rolling horn riffs just perfectly. –Tom Breihan\nListen: Dusty Springfield: “Son of a Preacher Man”\nThe Supremes: “Where Did Our Love Go” (1964)\nThis No. 1—the Supremes’ first—marked the beginning of an astonishing 1960s chart reign that included 12 pop toppers. Whereas many of their sister groups barreled with boldness, this trio veered away, mastering the seductive coo led by whispery glass goddess Diana Ross. As claptrap percussion gallops away, Ross sidles up to the typical teen heartbreak sentiments and instantly matures them with breathless pathos and sensuality. Punctuated by 15 seconds of blustery sax that hints at a full recovery, “Where Did Our Love Go” is a come down that comes on strong. –Ryan Dombal\nListen: The Supremes: “Where Did Our Love Go”\nVince Guaraldi Trio: “Linus and Lucy” (1965)\nPerhaps inseparable from images of pathetic little Christmas trees and ice-skating puppy dogs, “Linus and Lucy” is, for many kids, still the first “jazz” they ever hear. (It was certainly the only “jazz” record in my household; my mom held jazz in disregard as weird dialectic beatnik music without a beat.) That 12-note main theme (with Guaraldi’s left hand answering with five low notes) is possibly the most memorable melody on this list. Guaraldi’s crates run deeper than his Peanuts work, obviously, but there are certainly worse things to leave as your legacy. –Jess Harvell\nListen: Vince Guaraldi Trio: “Linus and Lucy”\nThe Band: “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down” (1969)\nNothing like a group that’s 80% Canadian singing about The War of Northern Aggression. Fortunately, the other 20% is Levon Helm, whose dramatic performance here turns a period piece that could have been a “Schoolhouse Rock” episode into a mournful piece of folk-rock. Helm’s vocals alone are perfectly evocative of the song’s character, but subtler and more crucial is his simultaneous drumming, skipping like a heartbeat whenever he gets to the really sad parts. With the rest of the Band bobbing and weaving within that perfect John Simon production, they get closer than ever to achieving their goal of escaping to a sepia-toned past. –Rob Mitchum\nListen: The Band: “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down”\nLeonard Cohen: “Suzanne” (1968)\nCohen wrote this perfect ballad about a night with Suzanne Verdal, who was married at the time to the Montreal sculptor Armand Vaillancourt. It was initially a poem, “Suzanne Takes You Down,” collected in Parasites of Heaven, and the drenched dreamscape language situates the listener via all senses: “And she shows you where to look/Among the garbage and the flowers/There are heroes in the seaweed/There are children in the morning.” Suzanne, holding a mirror, supposedly really did give Cohen tea and they had some sort of slinky walking tour of Montreal and the St. Lawrence River, but, also supposedly, they didn't sleep together—didn’t want to ruin the wavelength. Still, even without the nookie, Cohen recasts the night as worthy of the Bible—turning the simplest moment into something extraordinary. –Brandon Stosuy\nListen: Leonard Cohen: “Suzanne”\nThe Zombies: “This Will Be Our Year” (1968)\nLike the rose-colored finale of a feel-good musical, this proto-twee anthem has always felt over (the top) before it begins—an incandescent, elegiac bit of closure. “Time of the Season”’s the more generally beloved track from Odessey and Oracle and has received the most Hollywood hippie lip-service, but this track’s baroque pop brevity uplifts more grandly: Like “Happy Together” lined with rays of psychedelic sunshine (vocal-harmony mouthing piano, trumpets, ornate choral harmonies, and warm drums that link it in my head to Pet Sounds and Forever Changes). When singer Colin Blunstone says, “And I won’t forget the way you said/‘Darling I love you’/You gave me faith to go on,” he creates a smeared palimpsest that tugs my heart every time. It’s ironic that the group who penned this eternally optimistic song had disbanded by the time the album hit the shelves. –Brandon Stosuy\nListen: The Zombies: “This Will Be Our Year”\nThe Rolling Stones: “Sympathy for the Devil” (1968)\nIt was a ballsy move for Mick Jagger to sing about Satan in the first person, and it was even ballsier to make him so damn likable, a charming rake with a sense of decorum and a way with words. “Sympathy” may be Jagger’s finest lyrical moment; in a few quick strokes, he weaves the Crucifiction, the Hundred Years’ War, the October Revolution, World War II, and the assassinations of the Kennedys into an interlocking tapestry of human cruelty, and then he takes credit for all of it. Even ballsier may be the Stones’ use of the sort of rippling African grooves that pale-faced rockstars usually deploy when they’re trying to sound warm and life affirming. It’s an exhilarating piece of work, especially as the song builds and Keith Richards starts using his guitar the same way the Bomb Squad used sirens, a trebly fuzzbomb exploding into the sinuous mess. –Tom Breihan\nListen: The Rolling Stones: “Sympathy for the Devil”\nThe Meters: “Cissy Strut” (1969)\nWhen the first moments of the first song of your first album are as crisp and chilling as the “Aaaaaa-yah!” and fat chords that open “Cissy Strut,” hyperbole tends to abound. New Orleans demigods and house band for Allen freakin’ Toussaint before they were out of their infancy, the Meters were the peak of precise, slashing through each other’s instruments and whipping up funk like it was chicken salad—thoroughly, deliciously, and fast.\nArt Neville ran shit from on high behind that keyboard, but the interplay between guitarist Leo Nocentelli and drummer Zigaboo Modeliste is near impossible to compute. Which explains why the track has been flipped more than 20 times on hip-hop records ranging from Onyx’s “Bacdafucup” to Raheem’s “5th Ward.” There are few songs that pop with the kind of instrumental arrogance “Cissy Strut” carries. In doing so, and basically laying the concrete for funk music, they set the standard for talking loud and saying nothing. In a good way. –Sean Fennessey\nListen: The Meters: “Cissy Strut”\nSimon & Garfunkel: “The Sound of Silence” (1965)\n“Hello darkness, my old friend.” Few songs sink their hooks into a listener as instantly as this classic ode to alienation. Paul Simon’s tautly crafted lyrics unfold effortlessly as his harmonies with Art Garfunkel grow in emotional intensity. Those elements were already in place when the duo recorded “The Sound of Silence” for its folk-damaged debut, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. But after that album flopped and Simon & Garfunkel called it quits (for the first time), producer Tom Wilson took the folk frame of the original and added a rock edge. Inspired by the Byrds and Dylan’s evolution to electric, Wilson overdubbed electric guitars, bass, and drums. Not only did the new version reach No. 1, those additions also helped shed the original’s choirboy wimpiness. –John Motley\nListen: Simon & Garfunkel: “The Sound of Silence”\n13th Floor Elevators: “You’re Gonna Miss Me” (1966)\nI need to do the research, but I doubt the electric jug was ever put to such good use. For this convulsive harmonica-singed garage-psychedelia blast, Tommy Hall pilots it as a twittering army of sopping-wet percussive mini-moogs. Then, of course, come Roky Erickson’s vocalizations, threats, and promises (“oh, you’re gonna miss me”) with patterns that feel less like rock lyricism and more like looped jazz frenetics (or, hey, Astral Weeks). This was the Austin band’s first single and only real hit, and its history seems endless: Erickson recorded it once before with his earlier band, the Spades; forty-something years later, it’s the title of Keven McAlester’s documentary about the man’s life/work. It even greets you on Erickson’s website. He’s unfortunately become one of those figures, like Daniel Johnston or Syd Barrett, fetishized by some for his mental illness. Fuck that. Listen to this track, recorded before he spent time in an institution and allegedly received shock therapy: Erickson was already possessed with rock’n’roll genius. –Brandon Stosuy\nListen: 13th Floor Elevators: “You’re Gonna Miss Me”\nJohnny Cash: “Ring of Fire” (1963)\nThat Cash could adopt a goofy conceit like this (not just any ring of fire, a burning one), drape it in mariachi music, and still come out looking twice as big a man as your favorite uncle, father, and grandfather combined says more than any glorified MOTW ever could. If composure in the face of death is proof of character, composure in the face of love is downright molecular; here’s a man singing about “wild desire” and “falling like a child” straight from the ashes at the bottom of his stomach. That “Ring of Fire” was one of his biggest hits is no easily explainable trick of the chorus either—there’s a booming posture to this that, 50 years removed, still extends out across his many decades. It’s why people loved seeing him sing even more than they loved hearing him. –Mark Pytlik\nListen: Johnny Cash: “Ring of Fire”\nThe Who: “The Kids Are Alright” (1965)\nThat big opening chord sounds like a challenge to the Beatles of a “A Hard Day’s Night.” Sure enough, the Who turn in a gorgeous, sophisticated pop song that focuses the band’s sick instrumental prowess into three minutes of kinetic melancholy. Those vocal harmonies positively soar on Pete Townshend’s guitar jangle, and the modulation at the end is brilliant, preceded by just a tiny snatch of raucous Sturm und Drang. Roger Daltrey’s vocal has just the right tinge of sadness as he heaves the inner conflict stoked by his relationship on the table for all to see. –Joe Tangari\nListen: The Who: “The Kids Are Alright”\nJames Brown & the Famous Flames: “It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World” (1966)\nFor all of its sweat-soaked machismo and fist-pump funk, Brown’s most potent 1960s statement was a relatively quiet, distinctly feminine testament to intrinsic dependence. “A man who don’t have a woman,” squeals the conflicted soul man, “he’s lost in the wilderness.” It’s as if he could foresee his post-70s wasteland, when allegations of domestic abuse outnumbered hit singles, but was utterly helpless to stop the spiral. The ballad’s titular emphasis and man-made roll call only serve to underline its loneliness and desperation. Against arch string plucks, lagging piano, and snap rimshots, the man works his demons hard. And this direct feed into his struggle is as stunning as the ensuing wreckage is stunningly pitiful. –Ryan Dombal\nListen: James Brown & the Famous Flames: “It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World”\nEnnio Morricone: “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (Main Theme)” (1966)\nFilm was the most important medium of the 20th century, and Ennio Morricone was among its chief architects. “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly” didn’t simply reinvent soundtracks; it reinvented movies. For even the most uncouth audiences, the titular theme—hell, just the opening “wah-wah-wah”—is synonymous with stoicism, murder, and pop-art delirium. Despite the Wagnerian crescendos and theatrical irony, every effect is critical and unforgettable: pacing boots, tribal flutes, flaring surf guitar, Indian warwhoops, field-recording flotsam, meth-mangled trumpet solos. In just under three minutes, Morricone condenses all the greatest elements of music—from opera, garage, musique concrète, peyote songs, whatever—and layers them over stampeding horses and shotgun blasts. It’s kaleidoscopic, exhilarating, and incontrovertibly badass. –Alex Linhardt\nListen: Ennio Morricone: “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (Main Theme)”\nNico: “These Days” (1967)\nIt’s not hard to imagine hearing Nico’s low register and ineffable sadness over a less extravagant combination of instruments on “These Days.” This could well have been another coffeehouse folk song about day-to-day drudgery and the disappearance of passion—especially because those damn strings, skipping around and over the delicate guitar, weren’t supposed to be there in the first place. Producer Tom Wilson added them after the recording, much to the chagrin of Nico, who later called its parent album, Chelsea Girl, “unlistenable.” Psssht. The grandeur of her melancholy is less restrained when there’s a viola chipping away at the melody, but there’s no gussying up or glossing over the punishing closing sentiment, perhaps an acknowledgement of the chanteuse’s already intense heroin addiction: “Please don’t confront me with my failures/I had not forgotten them.” –Sean Fennessey\nListen: Nico: “These Days”\nThe Shangri-Las: “Leader of the Pack” (1964)\nTeen melodrama was a valuable commodity in the 1960s, but few girl groups did it as darkly or as well as the death-obsessed Shangri-Las. “Leader of the Pack”—on which the Weiss and Genser twins spun spoken-word and saccharine singing into the tale of a local tough who’s killed in a motorcycle crash on the night the narrator breaks up with him, per her father’s orders—is part concise musical theater, part novelty song, and all avant-garde, thanks in no small part to George “Shadow” Morton’s inventive production. Every element of the song mimetically refers to its tacit catastrophe—the cardiac percussion limns heart-pumping urgency; stately piano chords suddenly tumble as if they’ve hit wet asphalt; and while the crisis is never explicitly named, the throaty motorcycle revs, horrible crashing sounds, and cries of “Look out look out look out!” leave little room for ambiguity. –Brian Howe\nListen: The Shangri-Las: “Leader of the Pack”\nThe Kinks: “Waterloo Sunset” (1967)\nThe protagonist’s ritualistic observations have always reminded me of Death in Venice minus the overt dissipation: The “dirty old” Thames, Waterloo Station, and a 1960s orange-red nighttime London sky reimagined as a private paradise by the window pane’s light. Ray Davies’ airy harmonies compliment the rarefied aestheticism: “Busy-busy” causes vertigo, taxi lights scald eyes, it’s too cold to venture outside. This was supposedly the first track he produced on his own and every detail works to reconfirm a sensibility: The sporty intro sidesteps into the unmistakable vocal melody played first on guitar, then sung by Davies. Throughout, a scrappy rhythm guitar abuts an angelic harmonic web, balancing vicarious experience with the gorgeous hands-on pageantry of the city. –Brandon Stosuy\nListen: The Kinks: “Waterloo Sunset”\nOtis Redding: “(Sittin’ on) The Dock of the Bay” (1968)\nReleased at the beginning of 1968, Redding’s posthumous hit was a lamenting—and prescient—cry of resignation after the Summer of Love. It’s as immortal a song as R&B ever produced, renouncing all references to the transitory pleasures of love, rage, or infatuation. There’s merely Redding’s piteous hum, balanced by buoying guitar and slumberous horns. He sounds like a disappointed god, bored by infinity and captivated by his own constancy. The voice is soft and sleek, and traces of anger still disturb the serenity. The lyrics pass from calmness to sorrow, pleasure to damage, bemusement to barrenness. It’s a repudiation of empty promises: Nothing’s blowin’ in the wind, no changes are gonna come, there’s “nothing to live for, and looks like nothing’s gonna come my way.” He drives all the way to San Francisco just to remind himself that his life will never change. And then there’s that final nonchalant whistle, the most haunting and elegiac sound you could ever hear from a dead man’s No. 1 record. –Alex Linhardt\nListen: Otis Redding: “(Sittin’ on) The Dock of the Bay”\nThe Velvet Underground: “I’m Waiting for the Man” (1967)\n“The Man is never on time,” William Burroughs typed in 1959’s Naked Lunch. “First thing you learn is that you always got to wait,” Lou Reed complained eight years later on The Velvet Underground & Nico. Buffeted by krautrockist guitar blocks and insatiable jackhammer drums, Reed’s deadpan vocals makes a delinquent of early rock’n’roll piano and urban-twang lead licks. Dude takes the present-day 4/5/6 to East Harlem (that’s “SpaHa” for the noobs), $26 in hand not adjusted for inflation, then oh look at the time splits cause hey I’m running late. To think in Jamaica they’ll just plop heaping bags in your palm for a mere Andrew Jackson (I’m told)—though context suggests it’s probably the junk Reed’s really on about. Whatever, he’s feeling good, he’s gonna work it on out, and that brownstoned walk home is easy to imagine even if most of us have never experienced it. Oh, also many people heard this and then formed bands. –Marc Hogan\nListen: The Velvet Underground: “I’m Waiting for the Man”\nThe Beatles: “I Am the Walrus” (1967)\n“I Am the Walrus” wasn’t the first psychedelic song the Beatles recorded, but where the others were about the trip, this was about the destination: A tour of a surreal, strikingly vulgar place far out there (or far inside Lennon’s head), following a march beat that doesn’t quite fit your feet. Although the production is dense and full of disruptive voices and found sounds, your ear always knows where to go, thanks to that wobbly back-and-forth theme on the electric piano. And while Lennon barks the words, he also reminds us why the Beatles were the least scary available tour guide to this strange new place. After all, John (or was it Paul?) was The Walrus, a post-human growth on the collective subconscious—but he still looked silly with those giant flippers. –Chris Dahlen\nListen: The Beatles: “I Am the Walrus”\nThe Rolling Stones: “Paint It Black” (1966)\nMick conjures his charm school squall and Brian Jones makes that sitar chirp like a newborn blue jay, but it’s Charlie Watts’ crashing kit that slugs most every other Stones tune out of the way of this depression-incarnate. Perhaps overplaying his hand too soon (subtlety has never been Mick’s fastball), Jagger’s lyrics bellyache from start, “No colors anymore, I want them to turn black,” to finish, “I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky.” But it’s the persistent snare thumping and cymbal shattering that has led so many people to believe there’s some sort of demonic undertone to the song. There really isn’t. Seems Jags got dumped (or perhaps saw an emotional emptiness inside himself) and wants the whole world to look black. Kind of childish if you break it down to the literal, but to think about that swaggering cocksman now and imagine him crumpled and crying, scrawling, “Maybe then I’ll fade away and not have to face the facts” in 1966 is kind of heartening. –Sean Fennessey\nListen: The Rolling Stones: “Paint It Black”\nThe Supremes: “You Can’t Hurry Love” (1966)\n“If you’re not with someone, then they’re not meant for you,” Art Brut’s Eddie Argos declared in the middle of “Emily Kane” at this summer’s Pitchfork Fest. So here we are, mustache-deep in love songs and hate songs and Rolling Stones songs, and “You Can’t Hurry Love”—a little Holland-Dozier-Holland bouncer about the pointlessness (and frustrating inevitability) of getting all broke up over heartbreak—is still one of the few that tells us what we really need to hear. The ostinato bass, tingling tambourine chirp, shy Herman’s Hermits guitar, and especially Diana Ross’ suavely teenybop vocals (plus the hear-a-symphony backing oohs) stand in uneasy harmony. While the Beatles, Beach Boys, and Stones got all the white straight rock geek worship, the Supremes shimmied their way to pop perfection in 1966. Neither “Lust for Life” nor “Someday” nor any other beat-ganker does it better. Phil Collins can eat poop. –Marc Hogan\nListen: The Supremes: “You Can’t Hurry Love”\nEtta James: “At Last” (1961)\nWhen love finally comes, Etta James meets it with the unhurried cool of someone shuffling to catch an early bus. Maybe she’s too wounded, or maybe she's an ascetic, but probably she's just savoring—too used to going without to remember how to be excitable. Instead she’s content to stretch the moment out like taffy, itself a new kind of wait. But where her measured delivery suggests she’s entering into this thing one limb at a time, as if slipping into an icy pool, the orchestration tells a different story. With “life is like a song,” she even confesses as much. While she stands solid and resolute, dispensing her release in controlled bursts, the strings’ backflips, twirls, and knots do the rest of her work. They’re the butterflies, the relief and the joy, and they’ve never been more beautifully expressed than they are here. –Mark Pytlik\nListen: Etta James: “At Last”\nMarvin Gaye: “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” (1968)\nNot even the California Raisins could fuck this one up. Gladys Knight and the Pips took “Grapevine” to No. 2 in 1967, a full year before Gaye’s was released, but when was the last time you heard Knight’s version? Gaye’s take on the song remains perhaps the darkest, fuzziest, most unglued moment in Motown history. Gaye’s voice was usually an ecstatic lilt, but here it’s a frozen paranoid sneer, the sound of a man collapsing inward into doubt and regret and hate. Gaye clamps down on the “you mean that much to me” line with so much venom that we know it isn’t really true, not anymore. The murky Funk Brothers arrangement offers no respite: the organ bubbles, the Bernard Herrmann strings screech, the guitars echo and moan, and you know just as well as Gaye does that his life is about to end. There’s no hope anywhere in the song. It’s terrifying. –Tom Breihan\nListen: Marvin Gaye: “I Heard It Through the Grapevine”\nThe Beach Boys: “Good Vibrations” (1966)\nThe pressure to surpass Pet Sounds and keep apace with the ante-upping Beatles set the stage for this obsessive-compulsive, career-derailing masterpiece. Wilson amassed hours upon hours of tape at multiple studios to cobble together his intricately segmented, cut’n’paste “pocket symphony,” reportedly spending anywhere between $16-50,000 to produce three-and-a-half minutes of weird yet accessible pop. Besides its haunting organs, shapeshifting riffs, and cubist harmonies, “Good Vibrations” introduced the electro-Theremin (now often known as the Tannerin, its interface involves shifting the pitch of a sine wave by sliding a knob across a dummy keyboard) to the world at large, its bright eeriness audibly echoing Wilson’s knack for blending the mundane with the extraterrestrial. –Brian Howe\nListen: The Beach Boys: “Good Vibrations”\nThe Shangri-Las: “Out in the Streets” (1965)\nThe Shangri-Las perfected pop melodrama, and their best songs feel like a synthesis of Douglas Sirk, Beatlemania, Hells Angels, and a support group for middle-aged manic depressives. Yes, the group addressed the most lurid elements of 1960s suburbia, from rape and death to skull-smashing bikers and abused dropouts. But “Out in the Streets” accomplishes the tremendous feat of transforming teen-beat puppy love and leather-laced fetishism into the foundations of adulthood: nostalgia, boredom, and guilt.\nSurrounded by siren-like howls and orchestral plinks, the girls rue their own appeal and repent for sanitizing their bad-boy beaus. As a premise, this apology has the benefits of uniting pride and pathos: “He used to act bad/He used to, but he quit it/It makes me so sad/’Cause I know that he did it for me.” The underlying message is that we should hate ourselves as penitence for our beauty, and this song is therefore the finest distillation of the teenage dream ever recorded. –Alex Linhardt\nListen: The Shangri-Las: “Out in the Streets”\nThe Beatles: “Tomorrow Never Knows” (1966)\nWhere did this come from? Drugs, you say? Well, sure… Timothy Leary was involved, as he so often was in those days. His book The Psychedelic Experience, itself based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead, served as an inspiration. LSD had come to the boys a year earlier and Lennon had imbibed and things were changing fast. In another year, the minds of John’s fellow Beatles would begin to look rather small, Yoko was someone smart and hip to talk to, and the end was nigh. But here the Beatles are together—Paul’s the avant-garde one, as he’d later say, bringing in the tape loops—and the band together is a serious force.\nNever had pop swirled quite like this—the seagulls, the sitar drone, the sped-up orchestral bits. It was music without edges, all porous borders, one sound bleeding into the next. But it wasn’t some new age drift, either, what with Ringo compensating for all the space in his part by hitting each stutter-stop beat with double force, and the snarling backward lead zigzagging ribbon-like down the rabbit hole. Disorienting contrast is the power of this song—a possible bad trip talk-down that happens to be scary as shit—and explains why it loomed mightily above the nascent psychedelic movement. “Listen to the color of your dreams,” Lennon suggested, and an army of baby boomers was ready to give it a try, for good or ill. –Mark Richardson\nListen: The Beatles: “Tomorrow Never Knows”\nThe Crystals: “Then He Kissed Me” (1963)\nSome of the sweetest minutes in all of pop music. Lyrically, it couldn’t be any less lascivious—promises of fidelity, taking the boy home to meet the folks, and that kiss sounds more like a quick peck then a tongue bath—but it’s all so charming that it could melt the staunchest libertine’s heart. The Crystals’ indelible ode to chastity and monogamy gave license to a thousand indie pop bands who longed for a time when music wasn’t so (eww) sexual, but its real legacy is in everything from the Jackson 5 to New Edition to a thousand teen pop hits from the last 40 years. They’re songs for audiences trying to articulate the rush of a first crush before the sticky biological urges muck everything up. We may not live in a hand-holding world anymore—it probably wasn’t much of a hand-holding world even then—but puppy love is still a helluva thing. –Jess Harvell\nListen: The Crystals: “Then He Kissed Me”\nCreedence Clearwater Revival: “Fortunate Son” (1969)\nFor all the hype about the 1960s being a time when politics and music merged into a great shining sword that thwarted racism and ended war, few of the era’s protest songs have retained significant power outside of their initial context. Yet “Fortunate Son” has lost none of the ferocity with which it was initially written and recorded. Sure, it’s great to hold hands and sing “We Shall Overcome” together, but angry times call for angry songs, spelled out in blunt language and bold colors.\nJohn Fogerty was perfect for this kind of righteous frustration, his voice strangled but defiant, punctuated by “Lord” invocations and slurring “it ain’t me” into a garbled wail. Placed over a rhythm-section rumble and a pissed-off breakdown, and over in barely two minutes, it’s enough of a middle finger to be rightly labeled as punk’s cool uncle. The very fact of its continued political relevance only makes it sound even more livid, foaming at the mouth over how little has changed these last 40 years. –Rob Mitchum\nListen: Creedence Clearwater Revival: “Fortunate Son”\nThe Stooges: “I Wanna Be Your Dog” (1969)\nNo, Iggy Stooge (not yet Pop) doesn’t want to be your boyfriend. He wants to be your dog. Backed by fuzzed-out riffs and thumping bass, Ig speak-sings his intentions: “I’m so messed up/I want you here.” And by the chorus, he sounds as hollow as a zombie, insistently repeating: “Now I wanna... be your dog.” With a single phrase, he turns the pop trope of puppy love into a disturbing ode to submission, self-effacement, and sheer animal instinct.\nHaving defected from the Velvets, the classically trained John Cale handles production by adding sleigh bells and an endlessly repeated single-note piano riff. Instead of deflating the grit and toughness of the music, it elevates the tension and enhances the mood of numbed detachment. And in the end, it’s that unsettling sense of monotonous resolution in Iggy’s pleas that makes this sound so dangerous. –John Motley\nListen: The Stooges: “I Wanna Be Your Dog”\nAretha Franklin: “Think” (1968)\nFranklin brings the funk with gospel fervor, and the Muscle Shoals rhythm section delivers it with a swing in its step. Forget girl power: Aretha was the ultimate woman, not to be pushed around, and “Think” brims with the confidence of a singer at the very top of her game. It’s barely two minutes long, but the song is still a veritable suite, with four sections you’ll never get out of your head. If the “freedom!” bridge doesn’t shoot you full of energy and make you yearn for the highway, check your pulse. Aretha is dynamite, but this song is also a clinic in back-up singing—the interplay between lead and accomplices is so ridiculously tight one can’t even exist without the other. The group interplay cements the powerful women’s lib message of earlier hit “Respect” (and doubles as a powerful race-relations message). “Think” is more than just another excellent Atlantic soul side. “Think” is power. –Joe Tangari\nListen: Aretha Franklin: “Think”\nThe Beach Boys: “Don’t Worry Baby” (1964)\nWe’ve all been there. Shooting our mouths off about our cars until, finally, it’s time to put up or shut up. We hope that nothing goes wrong, but there's so much that could. We’d be sunk, really, if it weren’t for the encouragement of that special girl. With her love riding shotgun, suddenly the makeshift drag strip at the abandoned drive-in theater doesn’t seem quite so foreboding.\nOK, so maybe the appeal of this one has nothing to do with the specifics of the story, but surely we can all relate to the idea of support, how knowing that someone cares for you regardless of what happens gives you strength to do great things. And the music is such a perfect accompaniment to this theme, so damn cozy and warm, a tender respite from the stressful reality of the main narrative. It’s that night in bed with your lover before the big day, that night you wish could last forever. –Mark Richardson\nListen: The Beach Boys: “Don’t Worry Baby”\nThe Band: “The Weight” (1968)\nLike so many 1960s stunners, “The Weight” has nearly been spoiled rotten by that culture-siphoning boom-boom-boomer trash The Big Chill, but the Robbie Robertson–penned tune is deeper and more biblical than pass-the-pain ibuprofen ideology. Led by drummer Levon Helm’s slurry roar and hammered home by Rick Danko’s shouty backup vocals, Robertson mirrored Christian allusions to the devil and the end of time with the emotional dismemberment of small-town living. Certainly the Band’s best-known song, “The Weight” is pushed along by a chummy saloon-style piano line and country-ish three-part harmonies making it a no-brainer sing-along jukebox highlight, capable of raising the spirits of even the damnedest drunks yet still complex enough to arouse even the most spiritually confounded. –Sean Fennessey\nListen: The Band: “The Weight”\nThe Rolling Stones: “Gimme Shelter” (1969)\nThe Rolling Stones’ most malevolent song is now indelibly linked to murderous riots and racist bikers. Of course, Altamont was merely a reflection of this song’s apocalyptic politics. Bill Wyman’s trembling bass and Charlie Watts’ percussive lightning conjure up a fire-and-brimstone typhoon of blood, guns, and doom. Keith Richards’ hands are covered in barbed wire and Mick Jagger laces together unremitting images with no concrete objects. They therefore connect all of our greatest psychopaths—assassins, street fighters, My Lai soldiers—into one swelling throng. Scalding harmonica and torrential guitar scatter like shrapnel, and Merry Clayton’s feverish backup summons annihilationist gospel and risqué teen pop. In the last few seconds, Jagger proposes that, well, “Love, sister, it’s just a kiss away.” But no one actually believes that. There’s a reason the Stones aren’t known for their romanticism, and these sinners can’t escape the damnation of their own hell. –Alex Linhardt\nListen: The Rolling Stones: “Gimme Shelter”\nLed Zeppelin: “Dazed and Confused” (1969)\nI don’t care who you are. You could bring me to shows, give me all the best drugs, steal stuff from work for me; you could rock my shit in every other way, but if you’re not down with “Dazed and Confused,” I can’t hang out with you. This is the numbest, blackest, taking-the-least-possible-amount-of-shit track any rock band ever recorded (next to “When the Levee Breaks”). Sure, we’ve all heard how Jimmy Page stole his licks and Robert Plant is just a big hippie, but that doesn’t matter, does it? The bassline is what matters. Bonzo’s triplet tom rolls into the second verse are what matters. Moaning, wailing smears of acid noise guitar that just happen to point down, and something that lets me know it’s OK to be kind of evil sometimes—these things separate the fun from the fundamental. It’s the real shit. –Dominique Leone\nListen: Led Zeppelin: “Dazed and Confused”\nDesmond Dekker & the Aces: “Israelites” (1969)\nThe dearly departed Desmond Dacres will have to argue with Toots Hibbert and Lee Perry over who actually invented reggae, but “Israelites” is as good a starting place as any. Dekker’s mighty lament for the sufferer’s woe of the titular tribe still rides ska’s backbeat, but clipped to a stately lilt. The organ and stabbing guitar lock with percolator percussion for a groove that’s irresistible, but never bouncy like prime ska.\nThe warm, glowing, muffled quality of Perry’s recording—a ghostly halo of echo and reverb—was at least partially created by feeding seemingly paltry two-track recordings back into themselves. Dekker’s voice produces Perry’s nimbus all on its own. The swaying, heat-warped quality of “Israelites” feels like gospel and the blues, and considering the song links Biblical trials with the hustle of modern poverty, the comparison’s not as far off as it might seem. “Get up in the morning/Slaving for bread, sir/So that every mouth can be fed/Oh, oh, the Israelites.”\nAnd it was a huge hit, the first of Jamaica’s exports to reach an audience off the island, going Top 10 in both the U.S. and the UK. It earned Dekker a tribute from a (rightfully) awed Beatles and made him Jamaica’s first international sensation. Saint Bob would of course eclipse Dekker in popularity, but little in the Marley catalog has this kind of power. –Jess Harvell\nListen: Desmond Dekker & the Aces: “Israelites”\nThe Who: “I Can’t Explain” (1965)\nYou could stop this song after four seconds and still hear why the Who’s first single launched their career back in 1965, why they continued to open shows with it decades later, and why it remains a favorite more than 40 years on. Those syncopated bursts of contained explosion constitute one of the most perfect power-pop riffs ever strummed, and the only way to improve on it is to add Keith Moon’s hyperactive drumming to fill in the charged silences between the chords. If that’s all there was to “I Can’t Explain”... well, it would have probably still made the list, but the snake attached to that head is a great song as well as a persuasive argument against originality in rock.\nWritten by Pete Townsend as a blatant Kinks rip-off, “I Can’t Explain” ably replicates the Davies’ herky-jerky rock rhythms right down to the handclaps, but the Who supe it up with American pop harmonies and a hooky chorus that hints at their meaty, beaty, big, and bouncy singles to follow. Writing in Rolling Stone in the early 1970s, Townsend mused, “It seems to be about the frustrations of a young person who is so incoherent and uneducated that he can’t state his case to the bourgeois intellectual blah blah blah. Or, of course, it might be about drugs.” Either way it’s also about the best song the Who ever recorded. –Stephen M. Deusner\nListen: The Who: “I Can’t Explain”\nJohnny Cash: “Folsom Prison Blues (Live at Folsom Prison)” (1968)\n“Hello. I’m Johnny Cash.” That opening line, so deadpan and needless—everybody, especially in Folsom, knows who Johnny Cash is—may be the genesis of the Man in Black myth, even more so than the song “Man in Black.” Making such a humble introduction, Cash sounds larger than life—definitely larger than prison—and he delivers an electric, excited performance on his signature Sun hit.\nEgged on by W. S. Holland’s driving snare and Luther Perkins’ breakout guitar solos, Cash gives a shout-out to the Razorbacks (“Soo-ey!”) and after the second verse laughs a playful heidi-ho. But as the song progresses, his freewheeling energy becomes hurried and dogged, and he sounds like a truly desperate man, as haunted by the idea of confinement as any of the inmates—a measure of how deep his identification with his audience went. The fear in his voice still resonates decades later, long after the man has died and the Man in Black has become a canonical American figure. –Stephen M. Deusner\nListen: Johnny Cash: “Folsom Prison Blues (Live at Folsom Prison)”\nThe Beach Boys: “Wouldn’t It Be Nice” (1966)\nLove songs in rock and roll can be many things—lusty, lecherous, pining, resigned, anguished, sweet—but “Wouldn’t It Be Nice” is the rare one that feels genuinely innocent. It kicks in with a music box harp figure that’s quickly obliterated by Brian Wilson’s Phil Spector–sized drum sound—it’s the sound of reality briefly shattering fantasy. The reality for these lovers is that they’re simply too young to be out on their own. But they can imagine, and their fantasy magnifies every child’s naïve wish to become an adult—freedom without the mortgage, cars that need fixing, and lack of adequate health insurance.\n“Wouldn’t It Be Nice” has everything you love about the Beach Boys in spades: the Wall of Sound Jr., the scarcely believable harmonies, the dreamtime prosody, and the imaginative instrumentation. It’s the ultimate starry-eyed teenage symphony to God, and it perfectly captures the earnest devotion we only seem capable of in a small window of years. –Joe Tangari\nListen: The Beach Boys: “Wouldn’t It Be Nice”\nThe Ronettes: “Be My Baby” (1963)\nPhil Spector hasn’t descended into self-parody the way some others on this list have, but certainly not for lack of trying. Trigger happy, possibly unhinged, and now sporting a bizarre Hair Bear Bunch afro, if Spector had been a star in his own right, his trials and travails would be all over Court TV. Thankfully, he hid behind the mixing desk and the biggest, blackest shades this side of Jack Nietzsche, thereby preserving some of his legacy. (Like you can listen to “Don’t Stop Til You Get Enough” without a reflexive twinge of sadness.)\nCritic David Toop has talked about the disconnect between hearing “Be My Baby” on record and seeing the Ronettes live on stage, lost in cavernous British theaters in their immaculate print dresses, their live backing bands not even able to approximate the force of Spector’s Wrecking Crew. The first time I ever really heard “Be My Baby” was on a PBS special of all things, on a TV with a shitty mono speaker—and even then it felt Cinemascope wide and THX intense.\nBut if “Be My Baby” birthed modern studio pop—the point at which records became artifacts that could not be accurately (or at least easily) replicated in the real world—then it would be merely impressive. What makes it soar, punch holes in hearts as well as walls, is the lead vocal by Ronnie Bennett. Bennett’s voice was a little raw, unlike Darlene Love or Diana Ross, and her kittenish performance that strains slightly at the chorus transmutes the slightly sappy lyrics into possibly the best pop song of all time. –Jess Harvell\nListen: The Ronettes: “Be My Baby”\nThe Beatles: “A Day in the Life” (1967)\nThe Beatles had attempted ambitious mosaics before (“She Said She Said,” “Tomorrow Never Knows”), but Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’s epic finale catalogues every explosive element of the Fab Four. George Martin’s production revolutionized pop music with its avant-garde opulence. Lennon and McCartney’s aural bricolage elevates and parodies itself, and their lyrics distance the group from naiveté and Summer-of-Love idealism. Lest we forget, the opening line notes how someone “blew his mind out in a car” and finds Lennon cackling at corpses, media saturation, and humanity’s natural disposition toward violence.\nWhen paired with hailing folk and piano, Lennon’s portion is as wry and poignant as rock is ever likely to get. In fact, “A Day in the Life” is pretty much the archetype for the Lennon/McCartney duality, firmly distinguishing John as a nightmarish narcophilosopher and Paul as a pragmatic businessman with a schedule to keep. But with its startling juxtaposition of pop melodies and flowery experimentalism, “A Day in the Life” consolidates all of the group’s audiences. Here is a song for preteens and acidheads, surrealists and Sinatra fans, the Monkees and the Manson family. That final crescendo, with all its disembodied screams and orchestral terrorism, is surely the most famous—and strident—ending of any song in the last 50 years: a caterwauling assemblage of Zen humming, instrumental flairs, and three monolithic pianos stacked on top of one another. Somehow the world’s greatest musical icons closed their most famous album with a solid 30 seconds of morbid textural sculpture. By the time the dust settled, Paul was dead, atonalism had gone pop, and four Liverpudlian rockers became high-art heroes. –Alex Linhardt\nListen: The Beatles: “A Day in the Life”\nBob Dylan: “Like a Rolling Stone” (1965)\nFrom its first double-drum crack (which Bruce Springsteen later described as the sound of someone “kicking open the door to your mind”), to its mythical opening couplet (a perfectly seething “Once upon a time...”), “Like a Rolling Stone” is one of Dylan’s strangest and most enthralling moments, a big, shambling statement that hovers on the verge of total dissolution, threatening to shimmy your record player (and, potentially, your entire life) off the shelf and onto the floor. One minute in, when Dylan finally hits the chorus, glibly hollering “How does it feeeel?” to an unnamed subject (or possibly himself), his sneer is so convincing it’s difficult not to feel deeply ashamed of everything you’ve ever done, but still desperate for five more minutes of lashings.\nIt’s hard to overstate the cultural heft of “Like a Rolling Stone,” which puttered to No. 2 on the pop chart (the first song of its length to do so) and hovered there for nearly three months. In 2005’s Like a Rolling Stone: Bob Dylan at the Crossroads, Greil Marcus exhausts 200 pages dissecting the socio-political context and lyrical nuances of “Like a Rolling Stone,” ultimately christening the track “a triumph of craft, inspiration, will, and intent,” and, more importantly, “a rewrite of the world itself.” Certainly, the song transforms every time it’s played, expertly adapting to new generations and new vices, just wobbly and amorphous and dangerous enough to knock us over again and again. –Amanda Petrusich\nListen: Bob Dylan: “Like a Rolling Stone”\nSam Cooke: “A Change Is Gonna Come” (1964)\nFiltered through a vessel of honest hurt, message and moment meet modern gospel. Suffering from the recent death of his 18-month old son Vincent and troubled by the omnipotent specter of racism, Cooke caught the unsteady temperament of a nation. Struck by Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind,” the Mississippi native detected the folk movement’s crucial sense of understanding; they “may not sound as good but they people believe them more,” he once said. Sam Cooke sounds pretty great on “A Change Is Gonna Come.”\nAfter Martin Luther King was assassinated, Rosa Parks listened to “A Change Is Gonna Come” for comfort. The spiritual synergy between King’s preaching and the song’s painful vignettes is powerful. Both are battered, bruised but vigorous. Rene Hall’s classic arrangement, bolstered by French horns, timpani, and a flowering orchestra is pure Hollywood magic but Cooke subverts the Disneyland pomp with anguished realism: “It’s been too hard living, but I’m afraid to die/’Cause I don’t know what’s up there beyond the sky.” “A Change Is Gonna Come” was released as part of a single only after Cooke’s murky murder. He never felt its rapturous reception. Yet, as long as change aches for resolution, the song will stand. –Ryan Dombal\nListen: Sam Cooke: “A Change Is Gonna Come”\nThe Jackson 5: “I Want You Back” (1969)\nWriters and producers Freddie Perren, Fonce Mizell, and Deke Richards originally envisioned this as the backing track for a Gladys Knight and the Pips song, but Berry Gordy had other ideas. With a little rewriting he heard it as the perfect vehicle to introduce five kids he’d just signed from Gary, Ind. And as was so often the case throughout the 1960s, Gordy was right.\nWhat is it about this song that cuts through generations and trends and cynicism and makes everyone within its range prick up ears and loosen hips? I once thought my age had something to do with my deep love of this song (it hit the Hot 100 two months and a day after my birth) but here Pitchfork writers up to 15 years my junior heard something special just as clearly. Some of it is Michael Jackson’s voice reaching beyond its years, some of it is the Five’s supportive backing. But really I think it’s the song’s most basic structure, possibly the best chord progression in pop music history. The descending bit on the chorus is joy reduced to its molecular level: I / IV / vi / iii / IV / I / ii / V / I. –Mark Richardson\nListen: The Jackson 5: “I Want You Back”\nThe Beach Boys: “God Only Knows” (1966)\nI’m sure you’ve read these: “the world’s greatest song,” “Brian Wilson’s masterpiece,” “the most beautiful piece of music ever recorded.” Yes, the initiation into the Museum of Western Popular Music is always rough, as credible historians rush to summarize our collective experiences in short phrases. But for better or worse, “God Only Knows” is the kind of song that’s almost impossible for me to talk about divorced from the way it makes me feel: sad, in love, honestly grateful, but also a little hopeless. Even in mono, it’s like being swept up by a wave of compassion but still getting bruised.\nThe first words Carl Wilson sings, “I may not always love you,” are already uncertain, so if you need a tie into the legacy of 1960s youth culture, glance no further than the naïve but strained optimism locked inside this song. Yet Carl made this uncertainty sound gorgeous. The voices that sail behind his might just as well be a quartet of violas and cellos playing counterpoint that’d already been obsessed over a few times before they got it. “God Only Knows” is so ideally conceptualized and realized, critics can’t help but support it. Somehow, even that can’t turn it into an art exhibit; its humanity resists the attempt. To me, this song is a goodbye to being a kid, and hoping that love actually is the answer. And almost nobody knows if it is. –Dominique Leone\nListen: The Beach Boys: “God Only Knows”",
