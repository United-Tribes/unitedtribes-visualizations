Amy Adams, Zooey Deschanel, P!nk and Melissa Etheridge, among others, were earlier on board to play Joplin in movies that never got to production.\nIn all, the California Film Commission awarded $51.6 million in tax credits to 19 projects to shoot in the state. That also includes keeping the Universal Content Productions’ Suits LA series from leaving Los Angeles for a rival locale.\n“Suits LA is a show whose characters are deeply ensconced in the world of film and television. Being able to shoot here will be a huge part of the show’s authenticity,” Suits LA showrunner Aaron Korsh said in a statement.\nOther projects qualifying for local tax credits include the reboot Community – The Movie, executive produced by Dan Harmon and Andrew Guest, and reuniting the original cast for this film adaptation and an untitled Screen Gems project.\nThis article was originally published by The Hollywood Reporter.",

Wade has been overturned by the Supreme Court, look no further. Evan Rachel Wood made an appearance Thursday night (June 23) on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to talk about the fast-approaching season four of Westworld and her upcoming stint playing Madonna in the “Weird Al” Yankovic movie, as well as show off her hilariously spot-on impressions of the queen of pop, Alanis Morissette and Janis Joplin.\nAfter talking about what it was like to be cast in Weird: The Al Yankovic Story — “I burst out laughing, you just spit your drink out when you read that,” she said of getting the email — Fallon asked the 34-year-old actress to do her Madonna impersonation. “Everything she said was very intentional,” Wood demonstrated, tightening her voice and making it sound nasally to match the legend’s early ’80s speaking style. “She disarms everyone who interviews her by just sort of looking at them.”\nThe Phoenix Rising documentary creator then stepped it up a level by sharing that she had once matched Madonna’s singing style so accurately, Weird‘s director Eric Appel got genuinely annoyed he hadn’t asked her to sing in the film. “We always have a microphone here…” Fallon responded, pulling out a mic from behind his desk. “Would you do it?”\nTrending on Billboard\nWood then performed an uncanny rendition of “Material Girl” with the Roots band backing her up. And, as if that wasn’t impressive enough, she went on to do a couple of victory laps by doing her Alanis and Joplin song impersonations.\n“What in the world is going on?” an astounded Fallon asked, falling to his knees, just after his guest nailed “You Oughta Know” and right before she took on “Piece Of My Heart.”\nWatch Evan Rachel Wood sing impressions of Madonna, Alanis Morissette and Janis Joplin below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_EoS9Hn4nM",

He was 86.\nLongtime music manager Bennett Glotzer, who helped guide the careers of such legendary artists as Janis Joplin and Frank Zappa, died on July 9 in Los Angeles due to complications from heart disease. He was 86.\nThrough a partnership with Albert Grossman and on his own, Glotzer managed the careers of some of the most influential music stars of the 1960s and ’70s, including Joplin, The Band, Procol Harum, Gordon Lightfoot and Gang of Four. One of his most notable associations was with Zappa, whose career he managed for several years beginning in the mid 1970s.\nA graduate of Columbia Law School, Glotzer’s entry into the artist management business came after he completed legal work for The Blues Project during their 1967 split, leading him to manage the groups that resulted from that fracture: Seatrain and the multi-platinum jazz-rock outfit Blood, Sweat & Tears. Richard Greene, Seatrain’s violinist and fiddler, describes Glotzer as a generous, ambitious and endlessly-resourceful manager with a knack for solving seemingly insurmountable problems.\n“He was just kind of amazing guy in terms of getting things done,” says Greene, who Glotzer recruited to play in Seatrain in the late 1960s. “[Once] he got us booked in Denmark, so we flew over to Copenhagen, and it was all [supposed to be] set up — hotels, the whole thing. We landed and nothing was set up. It all fell apart. So there we are in the airport with nothing, [and Bennett] runs off in a rented car and puts the whole thing back together like in an hour or two hours, in a foreign country.”\nTrending on Billboard\nGlotzer linked up with Grossman in 1969 and formed the New York-based Grossman-Glotzer Management, which managed the careers of Joplin, The Band, Lightfoot, Seatrain, Tom Rush, James Cotton and The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, among others. After the two men parted ways several years later, Glotzer moved to Los Angeles and launched Glotzer Management, where he and his team additionally handled publishing administration and publicity duties for a client list that included Zappa, Nina Hagen and singer-songwriter Hollye Leven. During that period, Glotzer also dipped his toe in the film industry, associate producing Zappa’s 1979 concert film Baby Snakes and dabbling for a time in screenwriting.\nIn the early 1990s, Glotzer formed The Education Group, an educational video production company, which he ran until his death.\nGlotzer is survived by his son Michael Glotzer and daughter Liz Glotzer.",

The converted gas station is where Joplin, then a student at the University of Texas, performed in the 1960s.\nThe restaurant has been closed since early this month after the outbreak of the new coronavirus was declared a pandemic and officials ordered restaurants limited to take-out and delivery. The shutdown was expected to be temporary as state officials predicted the outbreak would ease later this month.\nOn Monday, Wilson made the closure of his venue permanent but did not provide further details.\nTrending on Billboard\nThis is the second time that Threadgill’s has closed. The joint founded by Kenneth Threadgill in 1933 had been closed for years when Wilson reopened it in 1981.\nBefore reopening Threadgill’s, Wilson had founded another iconic Austin music venue — the Armadillo World Headquarters — in 1973. The south Austin venue where Texas progressive country music embodied by Willie Nelson was nurtured closed after a New Year’s Eve 1980 party and was torn down to make way for an office building.",
