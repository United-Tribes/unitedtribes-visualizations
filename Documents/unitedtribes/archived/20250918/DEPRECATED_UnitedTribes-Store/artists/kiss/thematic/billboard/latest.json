Now, armed with $1.3 billion from its first round of private equity fundraising and with the backing of Conni Jonsson, founder of the Swedish investment giant EQT, Pophouse CEO Per Sundin is eager to replicate the franchise’s success.\nSitting in front of photos of Michael Jackson, Destiny’s Child, Lana del Rey, Billie Eilish, Barry Gibb and other artists Sundin worked with during the decades he spent as Sony and later Universal Music Group’s top executive in the Nordics, he sees ABBA Voyage as a template to attract the devoted fan bases of certain other acts. KISS, which completed its End of the Road tour in 2023 and whose catalog Pophouse acquired the following year, will be the next act to get the avatar treatment. Another possible candidate is Cyndi Lauper, whose farewell tour ends in August and whose catalog Pophouse owns. The company’s portfolio also includes the catalogs of two of Sweden’s most famous electronic music artists, Swedish House Mafia and the late DJ Avicii, for whom the company recently said it will release new music.\nTrending on Billboard\nSpeaking at the New York offices of law firm Morrison Foerster, Sundin says Pophouse didn’t cut any corners in creating ABBA Voyage — even footing a “shocking” Dolce & Gabanna clothing bill, Sundin says, for the avatars’ costumes. (“They should have sponsored us, it was so expensive,” he jokes.)\nSundin says that after KISS vocalist-guitarist Paul Stanley saw ABBA Voyage, he asked to meet the band members backstage. Pophouse, he adds, is dedicated to producing the same realism for the blood-spitting, fire-breathing “Black Diamond” boys.\nGeopolitical uncertainty and tariffs have not directly affected music assets. Did that motivate investors who participated in this latest funding round?\nI don’t want to comment on what’s going on in the world today because I can’t guess where anything is going. But music is totally uncorrelated to inflation or interest rates, and that is a key message for people who invest from the financial world. When we said to investors, “This is a yield business because you have royalties coming in every quarter,” the financial support for music is fantastic. Even though you have tough times, maybe you don’t go out to restaurants or do big trips, but you will never cancel your Spotify, YouTube or Apple account.\nYou may not cancel your Spotify account, but you do buy fewer Broadway tickets. How are you changing your forecasts for the ABBA virtual show or other live- entertainment projects?\nYou have to value in assumptions and calculations for every venture, but we’re not going to do nothing for four years. The world we’re living in, it’s always SNAFU [an acronym for “situation’s normal: all fucked up”]. There is also opportunity. There is so much need for entertainment. ABBA Voyage is the next generation of music concerts. It’s on seven days a week, and it’s almost always sold out. I’ve been 16 times, and I’m emotionally connected every time. That’s how contagious this show is. Of the 50 biggest artists in the world still alive, I would say that 40 have been there to see it.\nGiven the show’s popularity with big stars, how’s your pipeline for acquisitions?\nReally good. The press release about how much money we raised helped. We hope to announce at least one catalog we’re buying by summer. But we don’t just want to buy it and put it on the shelf. We create a road map for five to 10 years, and then we execute that road map. From the beginning, we told our investors that we want to buy eight to 10 catalogs. We have four. That leaves six to buy. The record companies have thousands of catalogs.\nIn the United States, ABBA Arena would be comparable to Sphere in Las Vegas. Will the KISS virtual show take place there?\nNo. The Sphere is a fantastic building, a fantastic venue, but for the type of avatar concert we are planning with KISS — which is something else — we are looking at more intimate sites. I’ve been to the Sphere four times [to see U2 live, a video replay of a U2 show, Anyma and the Eagles]. The first time I saw U2 at Sphere, the visuals were amazing, but I didn’t feel emotionally connected. Bono is a preacher. He has something to say to the world, and I didn’t find he was in the right element. I saw U2 virtual [a recording of a prior Sphere performance], and Bono was more of a preacher there. With U2 [both times], I asked people, “Did you go for U2 or did you go for the Sphere?” Two-thirds said they went there for the Sphere.\nHow will you give KISS fans something new for the virtual show?\nEvery catalog we buy will not be an avatar show. ABBA was only active for eight to nine years. KISS toured for 40. Kiss is more male-biased. ABBA is more female-biased. But they both have fans of all ages. That’s why their brands are so valuable. If you’re a KISS fan, you’re a fan for life.\nPophouse also owns Avicii’s catalog, another artist with hyper-engaged fans who are very sensitive to coverage and monetization of that catalog, given his suicide at the age of 28 in 2018. Would Pophouse buy another catalog that comes with a significant risk of offending fans?\nThere is so much data available to look at before we buy catalogs today. We also do brand and narrative due diligence. KISS has superfans. Taylor Swift has superfans. The same goes with Avicii. On Spotify, 2% of listeners of a catalog stand for 80% of a catalog’s streams in an average month or year. In some cases, we have found 5% [of listeners] stand for 50% of streams. If I can increase an act’s superfans from 5% to 6%, the total streams will go up 10%, meaning the value of the catalog will go up 10%.\nSo back to your question about sensitivity: We take this very seriously. With KISS, there are fans that have been fans for 50 years. We did deep research and collected 10 people into a superfan panel and invited them to Vegas [in mid-March]. In workshops, we asked them what they would expect, what they liked and didn’t like because we respect them. That doesn’t mean we will do everything they say. We will adapt their feedback for the next 50 years.\nWe’re going to do a superfan panel with Avicii, too. His parents are very close to me personally since I signed Avicii in 2010. I am probably the person who is saying, “Do as little as possible.” There are a lot of things Avicii never released, and we are doing Avicii Forever, a collection of his best songs — and one new song.\nWhat’s a challenge you encountered in your career, and how did you overcome it?\nThe first decade of the century was a true roller coaster for me, but also for everyone in the music industry. It started with the best year ever selling CDs, then came Napster, LimeWire and, eventually, Pirate Bay. Sweden was the most pirated country in the world, and I had to restructure Sony Music Nordic. Then came the merger between Sony Music and BMG, and I moved to Universal Music Nordic. I had to let more than 300 people go, and the music market in Sweden decreased 50%. We tried everything to overcome the shrinking market: ringtones, iTunes and many more. Nothing compensated. When I joined Universal in April 2008, UM Sweden had the lowest digital revenue based on micro [gross domestic product]. Spotify was launched that October, and I decided to go all-in and sign as many new and established artists as possible: Avicii, Alesso, Tove Lo and many more. In 2013, Universal Music Sweden had the highest digital revenue on micro GDP in the [entirety] of Universal Music.\nWhat are you most proud of from your career?\nEvery artist you sign to a label you feel in some way connected to them. I don’t think they always feel connected to you, but to sign an artist or band is such an important decision [for everyone involved]. Even though I’ve left Sony and Universal, I continue to follow the careers of the artists I signed. It’s emotional. It’s about creating an entertainment brand or artist who can live on their creativity. It’s fantastic.",

The (allegedly) retired greasepaint rockers known for such beloved jams as “Love Gun,” “Black Diamond” and “Christine Sixteen” made the cut along with country icon George Strait, Broadway star Michael Crawford, disco singer Gloria Gaynor and Rocky/Rambo actor Sylvester Stallone.\nTrump said he was deeply involved in the selection process this year — including his plans to become the first U.S. president to host the show — and the choice of KISS is interesting given the president’s well-known aversion to anyone critical of him.\nTrending on Billboard\nDespite previously disagreeing with Trump’s actions during his first term, in quotes first reported by TMZ, the band’s members were reportedly joyful about joining the ranks of such past Kennedy Center icons as Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, Pete Seeger, Stevie Wonder and Garth Brooks, among many others.\n“KISS is the embodiment of the American dream,” said bassist/singer Gene Simmons in the statements confirmed to Billboard by the band’s reps. “We are deeply honored to receive the Kennedy Center Honor.”\nSinger/guitarist Paul Stanley added, “From our earliest days, KISS has embodied the American ideal that all things are possible and that hard work pays off. The prestige of the Kennedy Center Honors cannot be overstated and I accept this on behalf of the long legacy of KISS and all of the band members who helped create our iconic band.”\nFormer guitarist Ace Frehley called it a “dream come true that I never thought would materialize” and former drummer Peter Criss said, “I feel so blessed. This is the greatest honor of our career.”\nTrump was the first president to never attend the annual Kennedy Center Honors gala during his first term and until recently he had never taken in a single program at the beloved D.C. arts center.\nThe choice of sometime critics KISS is interesting because it comes a week after Trump unexpectedly fired the head of the non-partisan, technocratic Bureau of Labor Statistics after it released a jobs report he claimed, without evidence, had been “rigged” to make him look bad.\nSimmons — who got fired by Trump in week three of the first season of the The Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 — initially praised the president before he first won the White House. The rocker known for his entrepreneurial acumen called Trump the “truest political animal I’ve ever seen onstage,” lauding the former reality TV star for not having speechwriters and being “good for the political system.\nHe changed his tune a short time later.\nThe band turned down a reported invitation to play Trump’s first inauguration and by the time Trump lost his second bid for office to President Joe Biden in 2020, Simmons had a very different view. “I knew him before he entered politics. Look what that gentleman did to this country and the polarization – got all the cockroaches to rise to the top. Once upon a time, you were embarrassed to be publicly racist and out there with conspiracy theories. Now it’s all out in the open because he allowed it,” Simmons said to Spin in May 2022.\nSimmons told the magazine that the two knew each other before the Apprentice from hanging around the same nightclubs, but that being president is a very different job than hosting a game show. “You have a different responsibility when you’re just a citizen or an entrepreneur. You don’t make policy,” he said. “It doesn’t affect life and death. When you get into a position of power, it does affect lives. I don’t think he’s a Republican or a Democrat. He’s out for himself, any way you can get there. And in the last election, over 70 million people bought it hook, line and sinker.”\nSimilarly, Stanley tweeted in Jan. 2021 that Trump’s refusal to accept the results of the previous year’s election loss was “ABHORRENT. A true danger to our democracy. The issue isn’t that it WON’T work. It’s Mob Boss behavior and politicians putting party over audits, investigations, court rulings & COUNTRY in an effort to overrule the will of American voters.”\nStanley also referred to the violent horde of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 as “TERRORISTS,” calling the assault an “armed insurrection” by a mob who were all pardoned when Trump took office again earlier this year. The singer also noted back then that the “flames were fanned today & over time by the president [Trump] & specific senators who CANNOT be allowed now to distance from or denounce what they have directly caused. Know their names. THIS is the result of their deception. Shame.”\nThe Trump-hosted 2025 Kennedy Center Honors will air on CBS in December.",

In announcing this year’s inductees at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday (Aug. 13), Trump also revealed that he will host this year’s show. The show will air on CBS in December. It will mark the first time a president has hosted the show.\nLast year’s honorees, the last class to receive the honors under President Biden, were filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, iconic rock band Grateful Dead, singer-songwriter-guitarist Bonnie Raitt, jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval and The Apollo Theater in Harlem, the first venue to receive the honor.\nThe Kennedy Center Honors were first presented in 1978. The inaugural class consisted of contralto Marian Anderson, dancer-actor-singer Fred Astaire, choreographer George Balanchine, composer Richard Rodgers and pianist Arthur Rubinstein.\nWhile the focus in the early years was on fine arts – heavy on classical and opera – over the decades, it has broadened to also include more popular forms of music. In 1987, B.B. King became the first blues artist to be inducted. Other performers who were the first in their genres to be honored were Roy Acuff for country in 1991, Aretha Franklin for R&B in 1994, Pete Seeger for folk in 1994, Bob Dylan for rock in 1997, Gloria Estefan for Latin music in 2017 and LL Cool J for rap in 2017.\nHere’s a quick look at this year’s honorees.\n-\nGeorge Strait\nStrait, 73, is the first country artist to receive the Kennedy Center Honors since Garth Brooks in 2020. Other country artists to be honored are Roy Acuff (1991), Johnny Cash (1996), Willie Nelson (1998), Loretta Lynn (2003), Dolly Parton (2006), George Jones (2008), Merle Haggard (2010) and Reba McEntire (2018).\nStrait was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006. He won his only Grammy to date in 2009, when Troubadour was voted best country album.\nStrait has had five No. 1 albums on the all-genre Billboard 200: Carrying Your Love With Me (1997), 50 Number Ones (2004), Somewhere Down in Texas (2005), Troubadour (2008) and Twang (2009).\n-\nKISS\nKISS – Peter Criss, Ace Frehley, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley – are the sixth rock band to receive the Kennedy Center Honors as a group. In 2008, The Who became the first rock band to be honored. They were followed by Led Zeppelin (2012) Eagles, (2016), U2 (2022) and Grateful Dead (2024).\nKISS was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014. Rage Against the Machine’s Tom Morello did the honors.\nKISS has had nine top 10 albums on the Billboard 200, topped by Sonic Boom, which reached No. 2 in 2009. The band has two top 10 hits on the Hot 100 – “Beth” in 1976 and “Forever” in 1990.\n-\nMichael Crawford\nCrawford, 83, won a Tony for best lead actor in a musical in 1988 for The Phantom of the Opera. He received two Grammy nominations in 1994 – best traditional pop vocal performance for his album A Touch of Music in the Night and best pop performance by a duo or group with vocal for “The Music of the Night,” a collab with Barbra Streisand (a 2008 Kennedy Center Honoree).\nCrawford’s highest charting album on the Billboard 200 was A Touch of Music in the Night (No. 39 in 1993).\n-\nGloria Gaynor\nGaynor, 81, is a two-time Grammy winner. She won her Grammys 40 years apart in very different categories – best disco recording in 1980 for “I Will Survive” and best roots gospel album in 2020 for Testimony. “I Will Survive” was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2012 and the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2015.\nGaynor’s highest charting album on the Billboard 200 was Love Tracks (No. 4 in 1979). She has had two top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 – a disco remake of the Jackson 5’s “Never Can Say Goodbye” (No. 9 in 1975) and the immortal “I Will Survive” (No. 1 in 1979).\n-\nSylvester Stallone\nStallone, 79, received Oscar nominations for playing Rocky Balboa in two films, released 39 years apart – Rocky and Creed. He was also Oscar-nominated for best original screenplay for the original Rocky. The film also won best picture, but Stallone wasn’t a producer of the film, and thus, didn’t win.\nTwo Rocky films yielded No. 1 hits on the Hot 100. Bill Conti’s “Gonna Fly Now” from the original Rocky topped the chart in 1977. Survivor’s “Eye of the Tiger” from Rocky III logged six weeks at No. 1 in 1982.",

Bruce Kulick probably will show up, and we’ll jam, answer questions and stuff. It ain’t a concert, we’re gonna do none of that stuff. I may even bring my solo band up there just for fun.”\nTrending on Billboard\nThe event will mark KISS’s first public appearance since the group wrapped its End of the Road farewell tour at New York’s Madison Square Garden in December 2023. Simmons previously told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in March that the band would not perform in makeup during the Las Vegas event, staying true to their vow that the MSG show was their final appearance in full costume.\n“There’s no stage show. There’s no crew. We won’t have 60 people levitating drum sets and all that stuff,” he said at the time.\nKISS Army Storms Vegas will celebrate the fan club’s 50th anniversary and will feature Q&A sessions with Stanley, Simmons and longtime manager Doc McGhee.\nAdditional performances will include sets from Thayer’s former band BLACK ‘N BLUE, former Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach and tribute acts MR. SPEED and KISS Nation: The KISS Tribute Show. Kulick, who played with KISS from 1984 to 1996, is also scheduled to perform. It remains unclear if drummer Eric Singer will participate.\n“There might be some KISS tribute bands, almost like a convention, if you will. So it’s much more personal. And of course, we can’t get by without playing, so we’ll get up and do some tunes,” Simmons added. “What they are, how long, I don’t know.”",

And I wanna say God bless to each and every one of you.”\nGill then took over with the reporting, noting that the record is a “hard rock, kick-ass album” that features the production work of Barry Pointer, while Criss is joined by guitarists John 5 and Mike McLaughlin, bassists Billy Sheehan and Matthew Montgomery, and pianist Paul Shaffer. The record also features the talents of backing vocalists Dennis and Sharron Collins, and Cathryn Manning.\n“I was honored to listen to this album at Peter’s studio with him last night, and it was absolutely amazing to hear this new music,” adds Gill. “It was vibrant and powerful.\nTrending on Billboard\n“I’m so excited for it to be released, and I think KISS fans are gonna love this album. Peter’s drum sound is absolutely massive and his vocals are powerful. Barry Pointer’s production is stunning, and Peter’s got an incredible group of musicians and background vocalists behind him.”\nThe as-yet-untitled studio album will be Criss’ first solo release since 2007’s One for All, which itself arrived 13 years after his previous solo release. Criss had previously touched upon a new solo album back in 2017, revealing that he had a “half-finished rock album” whose composition could be traced back to before his 2008 diagnosis with breast cancer. However, Criss explained at the time that his retirement from the touring circuit would hopefully result in its completion.\nCriss initially departed KISS in 1980, having performed his last show with the band in December 1979. He would later rejoin the band in 1996 as part of their original lineup reunion, and following a brief departure in 2001, would rejoin the band until his final exit in 2004.\nWhile former KISS members Ace Frehley and Bruce Kulick would make guest appearances with the band in their final years, Criss did not take part in any additional shows with the band following his departure, and has not performed live since his retirement from touring in June 2017.",

The performance will be the band’s first since December 2023, where they wrapped up their End of The Road Tour with a two-night stand at New York City’s Madison Square Garden.\nDespite their large-scale farewell tour (their second, after 2001’s fittingly-titled KISS Farewell Tour), fans had speculated that the band could indeed take to the stage again at some point. Bassist Gene Simmons was quick to nix that claim, clarifying the band’s plans in an interview with Rolling Stone in November 2023: “I’ll say right here, right now, my hand on the Bible, it will be the final KISS-in-makeup appearance.”\nTrending on Billboard\nKISS had previously appeared without their makeup in 1983, beginning their ‘unmasked’ era alongside the release of their Lick It Up album. This era would continue until 1996, when the group readopted their iconic look ahead of their highly-anticipated Alive/Worldwide Tour.\nSince the band’s final 2023 performance, news had emerged the group were to bring their live set to the digital space, with these appearances set to kick off in Las Vegas in 2027. “It’s a must-see, go-to experience,” Stanley told Billboard’s Behind the Setlist podcast in 2024. “It’s beyond anything that anyone else has contemplated.”\n“We’re creating something that’s not a concert,” he added. “The idea of a hologram — and it’s not a hologram, but that term seems to get thrown around a lot — but the idea [of] a simulated concert is not what we want to do. Frankly, I would find that boring.”\nNotably, the email sent to fans announcing the forthcoming November show also noted that “fans can expect a special live performance from former KISS member Bruce Kulick.” While it’s unclear if Kulick plans to perform with the band or separately as part of the event, the guitarist had previously been an official member from 1984 until 1996. One of only two musicians to have not worn makeup while a member of the band (the other being Mark St. John), Kulick had performed with the band again at their KISS Kruise events in 2018 and 2021.\nNews of the forthcoming show also coincides with the fact that Simmons had postponed 17 dates on his forthcoming tour to 2026. An announcement confirmed that the dates were not related to Simmons’ health, but offered no further details. This same tour also generated notice after Simmons revealed he would be offering fans the chance to serve as his “personal assistant & band roadie for the day.”",

The anthology series based in the Marvel Cinematic Universe premiered its third season on Dec. 22 with an eight-episode run that concluded Dec. 29.\nTrending on Billboard\nIt’s the second high-profile synch for “I Was Made for Lovin’ You,” a No. 11 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1979, in the last year, following the song’s appearance in the 2024 film The Fall Guy (both Kiss’ original and a cover by Yungblud).\n“I Was Made for Lovin’ You” reached a new peak of No. 2 on Billboard’s Hard Rock Digital Song Sales chart dated Jan. 18, 2025, as viewers continued to catch up on What If…?.\nThe song is followed by a slew of tracks featured in the fifth season of Paramount Network’s Yellowstone, which began airing in November and concluded with its series finale on Dec. 15. In all, six of the chart’s 10 positions feature Yellowstone music, led by Lainey Wilson’s “Hang Tight Honey” at No. 2 (2.6 million streams, 4,000 downloads) and followed by Sam Barber’s “Better Year” at No. 4 (4 million streams, 1,000 downloads).\nSee the full top 10, also featuring music from Happy’s Place, NCIS: Origins and Squid Game, below.\nRank, Song, Artist, Series (Network)\n- “I Was Made for Lovin’ You,” KISS, What If…?
