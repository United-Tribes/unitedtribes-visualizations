No, I have not. \"Well, let's try our best to find it,\" he declares intrepidly, grabbing his PowerBook and preparing for what could be an epic voyage to the farthest corners of the internet. Of course, we find it in about 10 seconds.\nBut as we load the clip (an all-star jam from the 2004 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, paying tribute to George Harrison), and I show Bryan Ferry how to full-screen a YouTube video (an accomplishment that now sits atop the \"Awards and Special Achievements\" section of my résumé), the ease with which we've accessed this video comes into perspective. Ferry has just been discussing his earliest memories as a music fan, growing up in a working-class family in Newcastle, England, in the 1950s, when \"being into jazz\" meant saving up for a week or longer to buy one Charlie Parker 78 and then playing it, exclusively and obsessively, until it wore out. \"I had to be very careful with my one 78 a week,\" he recalls. \"I couldn't afford an LP at the time.\"\nAs the Prince video plays, Ferry studies the screen like a quarterback taking mental notes on a rival's game. He also provides running commentary throughout, gleefully making fun of Tom Petty (\"Ha-ha! They cut his mic!\") but mostly fawning over the Purple One's guitar prowess and impish panache; when Prince first emerges in this outrageously stylish crimson hat, Ferry-- arguably the most impeccable dresser of the glam era-- gasps, \"The red devil!\" In this moment, I'm seeing firsthand something that's also obvious from Ferry's varied and brilliant discography: Fandom is a huge part of his musical identity. From the innovative pastiche of Roxy Music's earliest records to his best solo albums-- which feature wildly imaginative covers of Dylan, Otis, and Lesley Gore, to name just a few-- the 67-year-old's career has played out like one prolonged, well-informed, and often-exclamatory conversation with popular music.\nAnd it rages on. Four decades after Roxy Music first glitter-bombed the world with \"Re-Make/Re-Model\", his latest project still makes good on that mantra. Featuring arrangements of Ferry's songs dressed up in a 1920s New Orleans jazz style, The Jazz Age just might be, as Ned Raggett declared in his review, Ferry's \"most radical work yet.\" After speaking with him, it also feels like his most personal: an impassioned mash-up of his early musical heroes' sensibilities and his own. The Jazz Age is also Ferry's first instrumental record, but he promises that when he tours for it in Europe this fall, he will also reprise his role as the devilish frontman. \"We'll do some instrumental things to open the show, and then,\" he laughs, \"I will appear as if by magic, like Prince, in a red hat.\" (Listen along to Ferry's picks with this Spotify playlist.)\nThe Ink Spots\nMy first musical memory is from when I was about five-- one of my aunts was really into music and she had a lot of records by this beautiful vocal group the Ink Spots. The lead had this lovely high voice and there was a bass who always did this thing in the middle where he kind of spoke. Elvis Presley was a big fan of theirs, and it was quite a big influence on his singing style.\nCharlie Parker: The Magnificent Charlie Parker\nI went to the local school and used to cycle home for lunch everyday. We were really poor, but I went to a great school. I couldn't afford an LP at the time, though I owned one, which I won from a radio program.\nRadio Luxembourg was this big station in Europe. Kids used to listen to it under the bedclothes because it was a bit risque to listen to that music; rock'n'roll was just starting. Bill Haley & His Comets took Europe and America by storm with big hits like \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"See You Later Alligator\"-- that was the first rock'n'roll tour of Europe, and I had front-row seats to see them. My big sister took me, and I just sat there, transfixed. Then Radio Luxembourg ran this contest where you had to put your favorite Bill Haley records in order of preference. I won it, and they mentioned my name on the radio-- that was first time my name was ever mentioned on the radio.\nIn 1955, I also started listening to jazz. There was a great revival of New Orleans music from the 20s at the time, and there were a couple jazz records in the charts in England by English bands. And as kids are at that age, I became obsessed, finding out who was who: Louis Armstrong, King Oliver, Duke Ellington, Coleman Hawkins, all the way through Charlie Parker. I saved up money and I bought this EP of the Charlie Parker quintet. The Magnificent Charlie Parker seemed the coolest record in the world, very different and avant-garde. I learned every note of that record, all the solos in my head. I can still sing them.\nBillie Holiday: The Golden Years Volume Three\nThere are certain voices that, as soon as you hear them, you're hooked. Leadbelly was one for me, and Shirley of the Shirelles, and Ronnie Spector. I love women's voices, actually-- I haven't got much time for men's voices, except for a few: Elvis, Sinatra, Lennon, Otis Redding.\nBut Billie Holiday is probably my favorite singer ever because she was so inventive, and soulful, and just so cool. The album I listened to all the time was The Golden Years III. It had all these really well-crafted songs: \"Summer Other Spring\", \"The Man I Love\", \"Body and Soul\", \"God Bless the Child\". And the band she had on this record was fantastic, especially Teddy Wilson, the piano player. I play piano, though I'm quite basic-- I use it for songwriting more than playing onstage. But my piano player for the last 12 years, Colin Good, plays just like Teddy Wilson when he wants to. He's a proper jiver.\nBob Dylan: Bringing It All Back Home\nI went to the University of Newcastle when I was 18 and studied art for four years. At that point I didn't know what I was going to do with my life. I loved sports. I used to play basketball, tennis, running, hurdles, cycling. At school, I was just going through different phases, though music was always lurking in the background.\nThen I started singing with a couple of R&B bands when I was at university. It was quite sophisticated because we had a horn section, and we did Bobby Bland numbers. It was a really cool band. We played around Newcastle, and then the rest of the band dropped out of college to become professional musicians, but I was torn-- I still wanted to be an artist.\nIt took me a while to get into Bob Dylan because I wasn't into folk music. It wasn't sexy enough, all sandals and beards-- it wasn't what we were into at all. Then somebody played me Bringing It All Back Home, and half of the album is with an electric band, which drew me into it. I've actually covered two of the songs off of that album since.\nNeil Young: After the Gold Rush\nAfter the Gold Rush is very soulful, very plaintive. Some of it's quite heavy, too, like \"Southern Man\", but then there's some parts that are really quiet. It wasn't a radio record, not in England at least, but when I first heard somebody playing it I was immediately drawn to it. I still have the album on vinyl and I played it a few weeks ago for one of my boys. My youngest son is a vinyl freak. He's 22, and he loves playing guitar and listening to various blues artists. And he likes Neil Young.\nOtis Redding: The Great Otis Redding Sings Soul Ballads\nI could have chosen this album for any year of my life, but I put it here because that's what I was listening to when I was looking for material for The Bride Stripped Bare in 1976. I covered one of his songs, \"That's How Strong My Love Is\", and I tried to do it really close, copying the horn arrangements that they did. It's one of the best covers I ever did.\nOtis Redding was a huge hero for me-- I even named my first son after him. But before that, while I was at university in '67, I hitchhiked to London to see Otis Redding play, just before he died. That was an amazing night. It was the Stax Road Show at this place called the Roundhouse, and I was just desperate to see it. The house band had appeared on all those records: Steve Cropper, Duck Dunn, Al Jackson, Booker T, just incredible musicians. Otis was the star of the show, but before him was Sam and Dave, before that Eddie Floyd, Arthur Conley-- all these great records that I lived with came to life in front of me. That was the first night I really thought, \"I want to do this.\"\nSister Sledge: \"We Are Family\"\nWe used to spend a lot of time in New York in the late 70s, and Chic was a great New York band. We made an album in '78, and I was staying right near the Metropolitan Museum. We had such a great time-- a wild time. We went to Studio 54, Xenon, all these clubs.\nChic's music was a big part of the experience. Nile Rodgers later became a friend and he's played on all my records since '84. He's just a genius guitarist and personifies a certain part of New York musical culture to me. Those Chic records still sound great today. My favorite of his is actually not a Chic record, it's Sister Sledge's \"We Are Family\". Whenever you hear it, everybody jumps up and starts dancing, and that's just how it is whenever he plays. But, oddly enough, he's also one of the most analytical players you could ever meet. Most rock musicians will say, \"Well, this sounds good, we'll just do it.\" But he'd be like, \"Oh, this is a minor thirteenth\" and analyze it in a musicological way. Nile's a very impressive character.\nPrince: \"When Doves Cry\"\nAnother American artist: Prince. He's a brilliant lead guitarist, but also a great all around-er: singer, guitarist, personality. He's someone I rate very highly. I like his uptempo songs, the ones with energy: \"When Doves Cry,\" \"1999\". I saw the film Purple Rain once, I don't really know it that well, it was kind of crazy. But by the by, he's really great.\nRobert Johnson: The Complete Recordings\nI also could have chosen the blues for any year of my life, too, but if I had to pick one artist it'd be Robert Johnson, who I was listening to a lot when I was 45. He's one of the great musical creatures.\nDo you know skiffle music? In the mid-50s, these jazz bands who played in New Orleans would also sometimes have a skiffle group, which was like a group within a group with an acoustic guitar, a T-chest bass, maybe a washboard. They'd do old blues things. One of the bands-- the Rock Island Line, which is a guy called Lonnie Donegan-- became a big hit. He was a banjo player and became a big star in England for many years, but his big hit was \"Goodnight, Irene\", which was a Leadbelly song. So that's how we originally discovered Leadbelly, through a cover.\nEels: \"Novocaine for the Soul\"\nSomething more contemporary is Eels. It's just this one guy, really, Mark Everett, and I've never seen him play, but there's this record called Beautiful Freak, which is really good, and it's also right at my son's heart. Everett also wrote a book, which I bought and have been meaning to read. I've got it in my case. But he writes thoughtful songs, and I like the texture of his music. So many years would go by and I wouldn't hear anything new I really liked except dance records, but \"Novocaine for the Soul\" is the one I remember hearing and thinking, \"Oh, finally, someone I really like.\"\nPhil Spector: Back to Mono\nThis box set has all the hits: Ike and Tina, the Righteous Brothers, everything. The first Spector record I liked was the Teddy Bears' \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\", that's a beautiful thing. He's a singles artist, really, so when this box set came out it was great.\nFrom when I was at university and onwards, Phil Spector dominated. The girl groups were his great creation, and those records are fantastic. There was a record that he did with Ike and Tina Turner wasn't that big in America but was huge in Europe called \"River Deep, Mountain High\". There was this guy at Newcastle who had a sports car with one of those 45 players, like a cassette player, in his car. We would drive around Newcastle playing that monster endlessly, again and again. Spector had that kind of effect with his records, he could sound so huge.\nIt would've been great to have worked with him, but I was always quite shy, I never really approached people. Maybe he would have thought we were rubbish anyway. [laughs]\nArcade Fire: Funeral\nOf the more recent bands, I like Arcade Fire, they seem to have a bit of a spirit; they seem to have the spirit of early Roxy a bit. In fact, my friend put me onto them sometime before because he heard them very early. He was a critic. So I saw them at their first gig in London. I love their approach and how they sound and running around stage hitting everything. It's cool.\nBryan Ferry: Olympia\nI put out a record called Olympia two years ago and got a lot of great people to play on it. It's one of those records where all the tracks sound a bit different-- some people don't like that, but I do. Having different people playing on different things adds richness. But sometimes, the albums that tend to be best are the focused ones, where you have one thing to say; After the Gold Rush has that flavor.\nThe track from Olympia I like best is \"Reason or Rhyme\", which we also did on The Jazz Age. To pick the songs for that album, I went through my catalog looking through various songs from '72 to Olympia. I always wanted to do an instrumental record, but then I thought, \"Well, how should I do it?\" The thing about doing it in a jazz way is that you have the chance to improvise. You get different things which you wouldn't have expected-- joyful moments, hopefully. [The musicians] can go off and do their own thing within the context of the tune. The tracks that sound best to me are the ones we do that are more Duke Ellington-sounding, more New York Cotton Club, with clarinets in harmony-- quite haunting.\nNormally, I'm working with screaming guitars, and I like that, but this record is a departure to saxophones, trumpets, trombones, things that sometimes don't sound so cool to the modern ear. But they sound great to me. It's the kind of music I listened to when I was 10.",
