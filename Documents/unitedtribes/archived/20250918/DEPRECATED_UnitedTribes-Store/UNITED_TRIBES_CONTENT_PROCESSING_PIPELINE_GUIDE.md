# üéµ UNITED TRIBES CONTENT PROCESSING PIPELINE
## Complete Step-by-Step Guide for New Book Processing

---

## üéØ **MISSION-CRITICAL PROMPT TEMPLATE**

*Use this exact prompt structure every time you need to process new books:*

```
I want to run the content processor pipeline for [X] new books I have sourced for United Tribes. 

The content lives in: [EXACT_PATH_TO_NEW_BOOKS]

Please move this content to the raw content bucket under the correct artist name in this directory, being careful to use the defined hierarchy of [artist]/books/title: https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/raw-scraped-content?region=us-east-2&tab=objects&bucketType=general

Once that is done, run the content extraction pipeline.
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Replace `[X]` with actual number of books
- Replace `[EXACT_PATH_TO_NEW_BOOKS]` with the precise file path
- Always include the S3 bucket URL for reference
- Always request BOTH upload AND pipeline execution

---

## üìã **COMPLETE PIPELINE OVERVIEW**

### **Phase 1: Content Discovery & Upload** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
1. **Examine content directory structure**
2. **Identify artist names and book titles** 
3. **Upload to S3 with proper hierarchy**: `[artist]/books/title`

### **Phase 2: Content Processing** ‚öôÔ∏è
4. **Text extraction** (PDF/EPUB/TXT support)
5. **Entity extraction** (people, places, events)
6. **Relationship mapping** (connections between entities)
7. **Intelligent chunking** (book-specific segmentation)
8. **Knowledge graph creation** (structured data format)

### **Phase 3: Integration & Deployment** üöÄ
9. **S3 storage** (processed content to ut-processed-content bucket)
10. **Vector store refresh** (ECS service restart)
11. **API integration verification** (query testing)

## üéØ **EXECUTION COMMANDS**

### **Method 1: Automated Pipeline (Recommended)**
```bash
# Navigate to processor directory
cd /Users/shanandelp/Documents/ClaudeCodeProjects/ut-microservices/ut-content-processor

# Run complete processing for uploaded books
python3 process_uploaded_books.py

# List books that will be processed
python3 process_uploaded_books.py --list

# Process without vector store refresh (testing mode)  
python3 process_uploaded_books.py --no-vector-refresh
```

### **Method 2: System-Wide Pipeline Update**
```bash
# Run complete system consolidation and deployment
cd /Users/shanandelp/Documents/ClaudeCodeProjects
python3 run_complete_pipeline.py
```

## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue**: `No such file or directory` during upload
```bash
# Solution: Check exact path with:
ls -la "/Users/shanandelp/Downloads/"
find /Users/shanandelp -name "*new*book*" -type d 2>/dev/null
```

**Issue**: Vector store service not found
```bash
# Solution: Check ECS services
aws ecs list-services --cluster ut-api-cluster --region us-east-1
```

**Issue**: Books not appearing in API
```bash
# Solution: Verify S3 storage
aws s3 ls s3://ut-processed-content/enhanced-knowledge-graph/ --recursive --region us-east-1
```
