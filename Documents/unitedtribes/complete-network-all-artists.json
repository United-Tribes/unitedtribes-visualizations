While several early Beatles singles had featured Lennon playing harmonica, he had been playing a chromatic harmonica... On 'I'm a Loser', though, Lennon plays a diatonic harmonica ‚Äî an instrument that he would refer to as a 'harp' rather than a harmonica, because he associated it with the blues, where it's often referred to as a harp. Diatonic harmonicas are the instrument of choice for blues players because they allow more note-bending, and it's easier to play a full chord on them ‚Äî the downside, that you have a smaller selection of notes available, is less important in the blues, which tends towards harmonic minimalism. Diatonic harmonicas are the ones you're likely to hear on country, blues, and folk recordings ‚Äî they're the instrument played by people like Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Charlie McCoy, and Bob Dylan.",
